{"": {"year": 2017, "text": "Coming from New Jersey, which has the most diners in the world, Nancys is one of the best diners I've ever been to. I thought the wait was long but the friend who took me there assured me that \"you can't rush perfection.\" It's so true.\nThe coffee was good, the rye toast was perfect, the crispy hash browns were crispy and filling, even better with peppers and onions. The eggs were perfectly cooked with the right amount of cheese and other fillings. The waitress was training but suggested I use two different types of hot sauce on my eggs-best idea ever. If I'm ever back in Pittsburgh I know where I'll be having breakfast! I can't find anything bad about The Pie Place. I get my pies from there every holiday and they have always been amazing. Also, the pepperoni rolls are absolutely amazing. I think the pepperoni rolls may just be the best thing there they are so good. I highly recommend it. The baked goods are very high quality and ample in size. The pies are delicious, especially the Dutch apple pie. There are also coffee options, pepperoni rolls, and much more. The service is fast and friendly. Great music playing in the shop! I was not sure I would ever see the day when a Korean restaurant would hit the south hills. I am Korean so I have some standards for authenticity and things I would like to see on a menu, so I was a little disappointed when I first saw the menu and noticed the offerings are mostly sushi and only a few Korean dishes, but still, beggars can't be choosers around here. \nI went for dinner tonight and had the chance to talk to the owners. They are really genuinely nice and friendly. They have prior restaurant experience from NYC and the husband worked with giant eagle sushi, so they have some experience to know what they are doing! They said they are waiting for tables to arrive, at which time they will expand their korean food options and also hopefully get BBQ tables. If you've never had kbbq and they get the tables, do it! It's an experience and so, so delicious. Pittsburgh is way overdue for a good KBBQ spot. \nI ordered the bibimbap with extra spicy sauce on the side. It was plentiful and delicious and authentic. They also offered me samples of other Korean side dishes. They make their own kimchi and it was fantastic. Everything I ate was on point and I ate until I thought I would burst. \nTLDR: this place is the real deal and I'm so excited it is here. I can't wait to go back and I'm telling everyone I know to go support these friendly local owners and their amazing, delicious food. This is such a great spot in the south hills! Sushi is great. The owners are very sweet and do a great job, check it out and support your local business! Service is always fast and friendly. Love the feel of the restaurant and the people in it. The chorizo cheese appetizer is absolutely amazing! I was in the area and thought I would give this a try despite mixed reviews, and was very disappointed. My dining companion bit into a huge piece of cartilage in his pork. The waitress took his plate and when the manager came out, he proceeded to lecture my friend that he wasn't used to corn tortillas and sometimes they can have hard bits. Once we insisted that no, we understand what corn tortillas are and that was not at all the issue, he put in an order for a different dish for my friend and then came back out and apologized because at that point he had actually looked at the plate and saw what we were referring to. Generally we're both really forgiving if something happens with the plate of food as long as it is handled courteously, and we're not argumentative, we just want to enjoy our dinner, so we were a bit irritated to get an unnecessary lecture as part of our dining experience. This was on top of the food being not that great, and rather expensive for what it is. I really love Mexican food, and found my plate to be not very flavorful. I would not recommend it. The food was exceptional. Not greasy, and very fresh ingredients. The service staff was polite and very nice. When the waitress wasn't around to refill our drinks, the bus boy was right there to pick up the slack. No complaints. Will definitely be going back. It's been years since I last had a sub from Uncle Sam's so I decided to stop in and see if it was as good as I remember. Sure enough it was as good as I remembered! \n\nThe place itself is just a cute little old fashioned sub place. The staff has always been friendly every time I've been there. There nothing really special about it so you definitely need to enjoy subs if you want to eat here. My only complaint is that it's not a little closer to me so I can enjoy it more often. All in all, I would definitely recommend stopping in for a quick, delicious lunch. I love Uncle Sams! Their fries are thin and crispy and delicious. They are always friendly and accommodating to my special requests. Went here one Friday night with a friend. It is trendy and was very busy. The restaurant is small inside with limited seating so I would highly recommend a reservation if they'll take it. Otherwise, I recommend getting there a little early. Parking was difficult in the area but there are a few small lots and street parking available. Our server was knowledgable and friendly. Service was quick. \n\nThe crispy green bean app was very good and I would get it again. I also had a fish special which was available at the time and it was amazing. Everything I had was flavorful and cooked perfectly!I ate everything and loved it! \n\nI can't wait to come back! Very good food and large quantity. Excellent French onion soup. One of the best we have ever had. Big hambugers. The smoked grilled wings are really yummy and the rumshakers BBQ sauce was awesome. The cod was really good as was the the reuben. Only complaint was the green beans were a little under done and extremely crispy. But other than that I would highly recommend I tried to find a reason to give more stars but I can't.  My family of four arrived this evening and were seated in the downstairs dining area.  The first thing I noticed was that it smelled like a sweaty shirt.  I don't know if they have had a water leak or what but the smell was not good.\n\nWe waited about five minutes and our waitress came.  She was very nice and took our orders for three cheeseburger specials and one kids hamburger.  When the food arrived, only one out of the four orders was correct.   However, our waitress did not drop the food and was nowhere to be found.  My wife went back near the kitchen looking for her and eventually ran into the manager who was able to get the meals corrected.\n\nSo, with the corrected meals we all dug in as we were hungry.  Let's just say that the burgers left a lot to be desired.  There was almost no taste to them at all.  Apparently they add no seasoning if any kind to the meat and they were very greasy.\n\nIn summary: relatively poor service, poor food and incompetence.  I think we'll go to Hal's or Stokes next time. I am so disappointed that this restaurant has closed.  I wish the former owners well.   From the banner on the deck, It looks like it will now be converted into a Mexican restaurant. This is a local chain that serves up some really excellent Middle Eastern food. They don't serve my favorite, Sleek, but they do have great soups, salads, wraps and desserts.\n\nThe service is excellent and I always feel welcomed and comfortable here.\n\nThere's lots of vegetarian options to choose from, for example, they have a vegetarian combo in the appetizer section that is amazing.\n\nI also love the smoothies, teas, and other drinks. This place serves consistently good Americanized Middle Eastern food. I've had  tuna and lamb plates here, and they've been good. The flavors won't blow you away but just about everything on the menu is tasty and well prepared. Wait staff has been knowledgeable about the food each time I've been there.  Waterworks location doesn't have a liquor license but there's a state wine store nearby and you can bring a bottle into the restaurant. Happy Aladdin's client over here!\n\nHad some friends over in early December before Christmas and picked up Aladdin's catering to go...ordered the hummus platter and the chicken mishwi platter.  The hummus platter was plentiful and we did not finish all of it split between 10 or more people,  It came with loads of pita bread too.  The pita bread was not made in-house.  They order it in bulk.  The chicken mishwi is served on rice and it was devoured!  It came with about 13-14 pieces of chicken and we probably should have ordered more.  Ordering was so easy...i called 3 days ahead and told them what time i would pick up....the manager brought everything to my car for me.  I tipped!\n\nNext time will order less hummus, perhaps I will go with a couple orders, not the platter.  Needed more chicken mishwi.  That stuff is so dang good!\n\nOverall, I love Aladdin's. Trader Joe's for life, guys. The people working there are so awesome, and the selection is always on point. This is the most convenient location from me, but even if it wasn't I would come here. It's just great, and Chick-fil-A is right next door so that's a nice plus. Never go grocery shopping hungry, especially Trader Joe's. You will buy everything. In case you wonder where all the good people go, they work at Trader Joe's! There really are the kindest people working here. My boyfriend and I tried the street tacos here a few weeks ago and were left feeling underwhelmed. The restaurant space is fun, and the service was good, but the tacos were only okay.  I don't think we'll be back anytime soon. \n\nI tried the shredded chicken and the carnitas street tacos ($3.50 each), and thought both meats were bland and under-seasoned.  The house-made hot sauces were really good, but everything else was a bit of a let down. I'll preface this review by saying that the young lady at the counter who took my order was very pleasant and helpful. \n\nThat being said, my girlfriend and I were both excited to see a Mexican spot open up so close to home. We placed an order for about $45 worth of food for a large dinner to go. Five tacos, loaded nachos and a burrito for me. Carne Asada on everything of mine.\n\nThe nachos were definitely not a $10 portion. The meat was just a small pile of flavorless, burnt pebbles, and the guacamole was quite brown. The chips tasted good, but this fact didn't come close to making up for the negatives.\n\nMy tacos had the same hard, burned steak, and despite the shells being good, they were, as a whole, pretty bad. Nothing like the glorious, delicious tacos I'm used to getting from Las Palmas. My girlfriend got a different variety of meat, but she was underwhelmed as well.\n\nThe biggest letdown was my burrito, which also contained the \"steak\". As a whole, the burrito was tiny, flavorless, and extremely disappointing. I am not exaggerating when I say that Taco Bell has better burritos. For the price, I could get something exponentially better from Mad Mex, Steel Cactus, or even Chipotle.\n\nMaybe the kitchen staff was having an off night, but seriously... for $45, I expected something appetizing and filling. I got neither. As disappointing as it is to pass on a restaurant within easy walking distance (and we both love Mexican), this was really bad. Bad enough for us to not give the place a second chance. I was very glad to see a burrito/taco joint move into the neighborhood. I have been hoping for this for years. And, for some reason, I keep ordering from their even though it's pretty bad. Out of approximately 10 burritos, only one was edible.  The other 9 we separated into a few bites of meat, then a few bites of rice and so forth. And why do their burritos require an additional charge to add beans or cheese? Are they not staple ingredients of a burrito? The chips are greasy and the salsa has no flavor. The tacos while they are not offensive, they are far from good or filling. In the end, I think the owners should probably try other taquerias in the area or restaurants in general. Also, training your cooks how to roll a burrito, so the food is evenly mixed, should not take weeks. Also, handing out a tiny container of house-made sauce doesn't cover up enough for bland food. I have even emailed the restaurant my thoughts in a far friendlier email....no response. If you want to try to eat there, I recommend soon, I fear it may not last. Viva whoever replaces this dump.... Emerging among the higher end restaurants in the neighborhood, this new taco joint is exactly what Regent Square needed - great food at affordable prices with quick made-to-order service. The tacos blend interesting tastes to authentic perfection on your choice of corn (or flour) tortilla. While you will be more than pleased with the variety of Mexican fare, the chorizo and carne asada are my personal faves, with shrimp rounding out the top three. Both the carnitas and the mahi mahi could benefit from more seasoning.  Nonetheless, the carnivore and vegetarian will be all smiles with ample selections for both.  And those fresh salsas and limes to top anything and everything with are priceless. They open at 11 for the Breakfast burrito, but don't you worry about the time...the combo of eggs, cheese, pico, and fries (oh my!) is perfect morning, noon or night. The California burrito is also a real dandy.  I recently had my first Tijuana Street Dog out in Tucson, AZ, so that will be item numero uno on the next visit.  If we can't get a taco truck on every corner, El Burro (Numero Dos) is a stellar start. Carefully prepared Asian fusion cuisine made with high quality ingredients. The dining room and bar area are comfortable and inviting. Service was attentive without being annoying. Interesting cocktail selections with premium spirits and fresh squeezed juices and house made syrups. I loved the seasonal sangria. Went with 8 co-workers after a meeting. On the way to dinner read the reviews noticed some service concerns. However this was a great experience. Not only was the food excellent but the service was very good. Would recommend this restaurant. I love this place!! It's very cozy and the perfect place to meet up with friends to just chat. They have the most amazing cinnamon buns. The cookies, pies and cheese cake looked amazing! I would definitely recommend coming to this place to enjoy a nice cup of coffee and some desserts. On a cold chilly day after lunch I headed up here for a cup of coffee. I was pleasantly greeting and the counterman went over the menu for me. In addition to coffee, they sell espresso, teas, cold drinks, as well as sandwiches and desserts. \n\nThe cookies are very big but reasonably priced. They offer free Wi Fi here and there are many tables where you can sit down and either work on your laptop or just relax. I opted for their dark roast of the day which was called \"Black Magic.\" You have a choice of either having it in a porcelain or a paper cup. I also opted for a piece of apple walnut coffee cake. He was kind enough to slice it in half for me since I knew I couldn't finish it and save it for later. Again he served it to me on a porcelain dish. Forks and knives along with your cream, etc are located behind you which faces the ordering area.\n\nBoth the coffee and coffeecake were out of this world good! A small cup was just enough for me. They also sell coffee beans here as well if you want special roasts or decaffeinated. Take out is available. This is a great place to unwind, hang out with friends, or do work. Most definitely on my return list next time I'm in Mt Lebanon. I went here with a party of 10 on a Friday afternoon during the lunch rush. I called ahead to see if we could have a table ready & they obliged. When I arrived they had us set up at the cutest table in a great location, pretty much by ourselves so we could be as loud as we wanted :)\n\nWe started off with the soft pretzel (honestly one of the best I've ever had in my life) the Buffalo Mac & cheese flatbread & the truffle fries. My only complaint about all of them is that I had to share. They were all so good! \n\nI ordered the fish & chips for my main course and was very pleased. The portion was huge, I actually took half home, something this pregnant lady rarely does! Everyone at my table seemed very pleased with their meals. I did sample my friends grilled cheese and it was kind of out of hand how good it was. I've never seen a grilled cheese like that & know I have to get it next time I go back! \n\nOur server lainey (sp?) was attentive, friendly and very accommodating! Exactly what you need when dealing with a rowdy group of 10! \n\nI can't wait to go back. In Pittsburgh for steelers game, came here on recommendations from others, and all I can say is WOW.  Beer selection was top notch, as well as bourbon selection.  Food was amazing and the portions were amazing.  Staff was over the top good, very attentive and made sure we were well taken care off.  The best place we visited while in town, don't miss this place while in Pittsburgh Maybe not the best place for dinner, but this place has a huge list of beers and the service is amazing. The menu isn't huge but the flatbreads and fries are always a good choice. The bartenders are fun and I always have a good time. Great beers with a good menu. The Sharp Edge Creek house has a wide variety of beers on tap and even more to choose from in bottles.\n\nThe menu is good during the day, the burgers are fantastic and the pizza is solid as well, maybe a bit over priced.\n\nThey have a late night menu that has half priced items, including their \"bites\" (boneless chicken wings) that are my favorite. The Buffalo-Bleu sauce is great. Pricey but worth it for artisanal pizza. Our family ordered the white and the drunken pig. Both pies had the signature white garlic aioli sauce which was very flavorful. The drunken pig features rum soaked raisins that were unexpectedly good when paired as a sweetness to balance the savory salty ingredients. Delicious crust. U had 4 slices and I generally avoid. Cheese based food but I could tell from the menu that this was a time to make an exception. The owner Daniel is nice too. We'll be back. Ordered blue pig and stix. Pricey pizza at $22.99. Wasn't good at all, I don't know where all the hype is coming from. Pizza was tasteless and stiff as a board. Maybe it was an off night for them. I dunno. Second star is for the stix they weren't bad. For locals, this is just like the Pub and Pizza of old, except with craft beer.  It's an OK place to take the kids and enjoy a beer and get a bite.  Ordered a burger and wings. Burger was standard food service 1/2 pounder. Bun was a slightly stale whole wheatish affair.  Bourbon Maple wings came late and were drenched in syrup and bacon bits. Fries were just OK as they'd been sitting for a while.  I guess they fired the dishwasher as all plates and cutlery are plastic. I love Panera. I went to this Panera with a $3 budget hoping to get a cherry pastry for lunch. Unfortunately I found the water cups are kept behind the counter (perhaps teenage vandals were stealing soda or something) so I had to buy a drink separately. I could have asked for the water cup like the lady in front of me who requested plates and cutlery for her to-go pastry ring. However I felt if they withhold the water cups they might be annoyed that I wanted a drink when I wasn't purchasing a full meal. I am disgusted and will never return. And they are \"under new ownership\" too. Everything is great whenever I go to this location. It's a chain so nothing that unique but the staff is friendly and I like their steaks better than any pricey one I have had. The firecracker shrimp is the best. We just went to Outback over the weekend, and it was awesome.  We \"clicked thru\" and was seated at our table almost instantly.  Our server, Chris, was great.  She was very courteous, and knowledgeable.  We had a gluten free attendee, and Chris took her allergy very seriously.  They also have a separate gluten free menu.  We enjoyed everything, especially the tuna appetizer and the porterhouse steak.  I really enjoyed my Outback Steakhouse experience!  I highly recommend it if your in the McKnight area. Although the wait for our food took a bit of time, the food was really good.  The house hot sauce (I believe that's what they called it) was extremely hot but amazing! Stopped for brisket lunch special, it was the driest brisket I have had in 30 years, more like thin sliced roast beef, no smoke flavor, very disappointed. fries were only 80% cooked. Food is good (they have much more than just BBQ or steak), service has been exceptional each time we've gone. It's by no means an upscale restaurant, but it doesn't pretend to be. Great weekday specials too. The food is good! There are so many more things than just BBQ and Steak as the name suggests :). As for the service, it has been exceptional each time I've gone. The wings are crazy huge and at an excellent price! It's by no means an upscale restaurant, but it doesn't pretend to be. The regulars that go there are funny people and if you sit in the bar area you're sure to hear some hilarious comments from them directed towards a sports game. Awesome weekday specials too. It is unconscionable and frankly unfair that there is no Joe's anywhere near where I live. Not only does this fine establishment have mouth watering pizzas (meat lovers yum!) and a wide assortment of burgers, wraps, and salads, they take it a step further and have a breakfast menu so awesome.. and they deliver!  Their strawberry banana French toast is quickly becoming my favorite. \n\nHaven't been to their Edgewood location, but purely from my delivery experience, Joe's has great food and their delivery service is great.\n\nHighly highly recommend! Maybe a move is in order? (Or come down by DC, pretty please?) My husband & I were not impressed with Nippers. We ordered food for delivery. When I called to ask the soup of the day, the man who answered the phone said \"we don't have soup\", however, the menu lists \"soup of the day\". The pizza was expensive & just mediocre, wings were tasteless and had hardly any sauce on them. The Italian hoagie was drenched in dressing and soggy. Why they did not serve the dressing on the side for a delivery sub, I'm not sure. We were very disappointed in our first experience with Nippers. AWFUL! Do not waste your time at this panera. I ordered two pick 2 meals; each with soup and sandwich. both soups were half full. both sandwiches had one piece of turkey, one piece of lettuce and about 1/3 of a piece of cheese. I took pictures and tagged panera on facebook. they were so bad even panera removed the tag and told me they would have the franchise reach out to me, which never happened. The wait was very long, the cooking staff was worried about socializing than getting the food out the door and the orders were not prepared in order. Every customer was irritated. Panera is way to expensive to the type of food they serve to have this type of service and food, especially in a brand new location! Love this place! Service is good and the food is great. I like this location over others because I feel like it is not as crowded as the other locations. Sign on building said closed until further notice. Wasn't able to eat there.  No date on when it will reopen. Do not listen to Ashley S These wings are out of this world (no pun intended) fall off the bone, they may be a bit more then other places but they are worth every penny. I really want to try the other options there, only thing else that would be amazing would be to have fries. Btw the Mac n cheese is also really really good This Dunkin gets 2 stars. The inside \"look\" is 5 stars. I love this inside of this Dunkin with its exposed ceilings, open feel, garage doors that can open to the outside. It's got an industrial vibe. I also love the value. I can come in with my own travel mug and pay $1.06 for any coffee I want. Pretty great! When fall comes around, the pumpkin coffee is seriously great! \n\nJust about everything else is really not good. They rarely have enough doughnuts/bagels to meet the demand this location brings. The store itself is not very clean. The napkin/stirrer station is always disheveled. The. Employees. Are. So. So. Slow. \n\nSometimes they are nice. \n\nOften they are not. \n\nI think to myself often in this Dunkin that it's a missed opportunity. They can be so busy and really serve a LOT of customers. But, unfortunately, I think people steer clear of this location because they've proven to offer poor service. If they redefine, this location will be a huge huge winner! This is a great grilled sandwich food truck. We have tried many items on their menu and they have all been wonderful. Our favorite might be the braised beef sandwich, it is simple yet so flavorful. They added tacos to the menu and I can't wait to try them! The guys are always so friendly too, we love this place. If you want quick, great tasting food, run over to Iron City Eats, you won't be disappointed! I love this place. I've sampled a lot of the food trucks here in Pittsburgh and this one is easily in my top 3. Their Braised Beef sandwich is my favorite with their Pork Carnitas tacos coming in a close second.\n\nThey're also very friendly and chat with you while you wait. I get food from Iron City Eats quite often.\n\nHighly recommended! The workers had a terrible attitude, did not know what they were making, or how to make the smoothies. It was awkward, and only one woman appeared to know what she was doing. Ended up getting the pomegranate smoothie... my husband ordered a different one but I'm pretty positive he also got the pomegranate one in the end since I think they throw all of the ingredients into one blender and hope for the best. Very disorganized and poorly run. I hope someone else steps in because it has potential. Workers seemed very confused when asked about a lite smoothie was when it was advertised on the board. Only one lady really knew what was going on and how to operate everything. Also,  fairly certain my wife and I got the same smoothie when we ordered different items. I can't speak to the food though. Overall the quality of my smoothie was average. Horrible... wait staff very unfriendly and they were out of half the stuff on the menu. When I would have friends move me I would always feed them.  The price is great for how many people it feeds.  One stop shopping....grabbed the drinks while there.  Now living out of state and haven't been able to find anyplace that's even close. Super cute coffee shop. As soon as we walked in we were greeted by multiple people, so nice! The coffee is delicious and my daughter gobbled up the really beautiful and fresh fruit bowl. Lovely! We will be back! Great place for lunch, coffee, specialty coffee drinks and smoothies. The homemade soups are excellent and Kylie is extremely friendly and understands customer service. I will definitely be back. One of the best breakfast sandwiches that I have ever had. A fresh fruit salad and superb coffee. All organic and ever so tasty. Baked goods are delicious and makes me remember my mom's banana nut bread. I would recommend this place to anyone who loves fresh, organic foods. Still no consistent hours, do these people know how to run a business?? I would be afraid that the ingredients they use are out of dat to be honest. Came in on a Saturday evening and was pleasantly surprised to find a huge buffet.  The food was hot and tasty and fresh.  They even had curry goat and chicken, among many vegetarian options.  Well done Taj Mahal.  Will be back. I'm a fan of Taj Mahal.  If you're not sure if you'll like Indian food, their buffet is a really cost effective and easy way to try a little bit of the staples.  The restaurant itself is clean, cozy and very sensible.  They are equipped to accommodate large parties, and the buffet runs several nights a week and everyday for lunch.  Parking is ample, if you don't mind McKnight road - it's not hard to get to either.\n\nThe staff are friendly, and the menu has really great selections.  I recommend giving them a try....a cornerstone of North Hills. Wow. Just Wow. I dream of Taj mahal at nights .... Sometimes I am just walking to school and I am haunted by the thoughts of Taj mahal... I wish I had a car so I did not have to wait for friends to go to this place. \nThey have a great selection for the buffet and everything is just plain delicious (except they have a small selection of Chinese-inspired food too that I don't like; but it is not on them, I don't like Chinese food in general). Just do yourself good and go there. Make sure you go hungry because you want to eat a lot of food, even though you know you should not. Came in at 257 pm on a Tuesday afternoon and although buffet ended at 3 pm, the server was cool with us doing buffet which was a huge bonus. Living in Iowa and having limited Indian food options, the variety was amazing here, especially the meat dishes.  There is no way you can try everything and our eyes were bigger then our stomachs because we over ate but everything we had was delicious. The server also brought us fresh naan which went so well with the butter chicken.\nHonestly, the gulab jaman (dessert) was the cherry on the cake, a great ending to a fantastic meal.\nI would definitely come back next time I'm in the area. This place is simple. Which isn't always a bad thing. Except they couldn't even get their main feature right. It seemed like they don't get much business. Which explains why my footlong hotdog was beyond charred...\n\nI didn't notice until I was long gone, or I would have asked for my $4 back. This wasn't some grill marks. This was burnt solid crust dust. It ran the entire 12 inches, meaning it must have been sitting on the same side for multiple hours. Crusty, dried out nasty stuff. Ruined the entire thing. Had to throw it out. \n\nI wouldn't recommend this place. I've paid $1 for better product. Hard pass. After leaving my last review and being contacted by Red Robin's customer service (and when I did respond it took them almost two weeks to get back to me), they asked if I still had my receipt. I don't keep burger receipts for two weeks. Then they sent another email thanking me for my input and nothing else. Not even a 10% off coupon for my next dinner or anything to entice me to come back. Massive customer service fail all around. Went there with family and friends on New Year's Eve at 6:00 pm. We had 15 people in our party. The place was pretty busy so they seated us in the banquet room and there were others seated there as well. The service was excellent. We had two servers that were very attentive. Our meals came very quickly and the food was very good. The only thing missing was some good Italian bread. Never went to an Italian restaurant that did not serve bread! They were  large portions at a reasonable price. The decor needs a little attention. There was red tape along the edge of the carpets as we walked back the long hall to get to our seats. Not sure if they are remodeling or what. Overall it was a good experience. Sometimes we go there in the summer and sit on the deck and listen to live music while enjoying beer and pizza. Great place!! Would recommend it!! We had a larger party on a busy Saturday night. Our waitress was amazing and so patient. Despite the crowd and number of people in our group, the food was served promptly. I had the chicken tacos with fajita veggies and rice. The food was ok. The chicken was moist but lacked an flavor, while the rice was overly mushy. It tasted like it was sitting in a container for some time. \n\nSomeone in our party had ordered wings. The chicken was very good, but extremely spicy. I would try the Franklin Inn again, but not order the chicken. Chips and salsa were good. Guacamole was bland and boring. The rest of the food was unremarkable. Could be any generic Mexican place. In short, for airport food and price this is about as good as it gets!\n\nMy wife and I ate here on our way out of Pittsburgh.  I wouldn't compare it to Chipotle as some reviewers have (yes, it is a build-your-own-burrito place, but the flavors are much different - Chipotle seems much more clinical to me).  The theme of this place is \"Burritos without Borders\" and they have pre-made selections that represent flavors from different countries, which I think is very cool.  My wife got a vegetarian burrito with tofu and I got a pork burrito.  They were both excellent - if they weren't we would really only have ourselves to blame since they put whatever we asked them to inside.  For airport food, I don't think it gets much better.  As with any fast food chain, I'm sure the quality of servers can vary, but both of the young ladies that helped us were very respectful, informative and friendly - so much so that I even got their names to compliment them in this review.  \nAlec and Sarah S., listened to what we wanted and did a great job getting our meals together!  Thanks for putting a cool ending to our time in Pittsburgh! Great option for your travel belly. A twist on the \"traditional\" burrito found at chipotle or Moes, they have flavors like teriyaki, tikka masala, and Thai peanut sauce as well your faithful Tex-mex standards. Additionally they have quinoa, kale, chickpeas and tofu if those are your things :). They can do quesadillas, small burritos, larger burritos, bowls or salads. \n\nI got the tikka masala burrito with kale and caramelized onions added. It was exactly what I needed. Service was friendly and prompt as well. I hope I run into another one of these restaurants. I love Mexican and I love fusion food. I had tried Thai burrito last year at a different place and I love the idea of mixing up things in a burrito for new tastes! So today I tried the Tikka burrito here and absolutely loved the flavours. So it had chickpeas instead of the kidney beans, tikka curry sauce instead of the regular sauce and I took tofu guacamole (cheaper than at chipotle) and kale(freeeee add-on!!) to relish a really good currito!! Totally recommend! Although I have a small appetite and thought the portion size was perfect for me, I doubt that it would be enough for some others. For comparison sakes, I never finish my bowl at chipotle and always have to take away 1/4th of it atleast, but I know that it's perfect portion size for so many people I have been to chipotle with! One of the best Italian hoagies.  The only minus is you can't eat there.  It's for take-out only.  Best to call in your order first.  However, well worth an Italian hoagie!!! I had heard really good things about this place, and so was pretty excited to meet here with friends for breakfast this morning. I ordered the 'Square Breakfast' which is 2 eggs any way, choice of meat, and either a buttermilk pancake or home fries with toast. I ordered my eggs scrambled, with ham as the meat, with a pancake. They bring out ONE undercooked, sunny-side up egg, bacon, and the pancake. The server was gone before I could question my order, so I ate it anyway, since I was starving. It wasn't until I got home that I realized I only got one egg instead of the two promised on the menu, and 2/3 items were incorrect. For 9.50$, I was expecting way better service and at least the proper type and amount of items I paid for. I feel pretty cheated. Sadly disappointed. first experience is takin 4 star with my pleasure. I had a pancakes and side bananas on top, my girl ordered scrambled veggie, came wt side fries toast and jam. Both are pretty big plates. The thing i didnt get that lattes came with to go cups. Idk if its because i asked for 16 oz but not cool with me. A local gem! Great family-owned business. Wonderful sense of community, with local artists' work showcased everywhere. Pancakes that are out of this world. Service that is polite and efficient. Very kid-friendly, yet other patrons were all ages. The best breakfast we have had in Pittsburgh, hands down. Would definitely visit again. I don't expect much when going to a vegan buffet, but this was a nice surprise! I'm not vegan myself, but am a supporter of all lifestyle choices :)One of our companions didn't even know it was vegan until he was told, so that says a lot. \n\nAs much as I like the restaurant, I will probably opt for the regular menu next time. While the buffet is good, the flavors are all quite similar. The staff is warm and inviting, and the restaurant is a quirky little place. Pricing is a little high for Pittsburgh, but I suppose vegan food is generally more expensive. \n\nNext time I'm in the mood for a meatless meals I will visit again! 1st time visitor.  This place is awesome . It is super clean, well lit ,nicely decorated and has a feeling of calmness. The hostess was very sweet to us . It was buffet Saturday and the choices were plenty for a vegan buffet. Rice was cooked perfectly and the soup looked tasty as well. A few desserts for something to satisfy your sweet tooth. The price was worth it. I would definitely go there again. Great place. Went here for brunch prior to a bridal appointment. Was not crowded at all and we were seated right away. Not much selection on the brunch menu but we both found options we really enjoyed. I had the eggs Benedict fillets which were fantastic. Steak was perfectly done as requested and the eggs were good with nice runny yolks. The potatoes that came with it were also very tasty. It is a little pricey for my tastes, but for a nice meal and change of pace it is completely reasonable. And this isn't one of those expensive tiny food places, you get a good full plate. Our server was friendly and helpful, he checked in on us a lot without being overbearing. Will be coming back again. Had Katie as the bartender & she was awesome. Very attentive & held great convo.\n\nGreat food & drinks.\n\nJust moved to the area so this will def be a go to for us. Wish I could rate this brewery but considering we gave the host our name and was told it was a half hour wait, and my husband and I waited an hour. We watched the host walk past us a dozen times and not acknowledge us. At one point the host ask me if a man who stood by the bathroom door was seated yet. Really Terrible service and a major disappointment considering my husband and I live 5 minutes down the street from Stonewood. We will never be back after how rude and not acknowledged we feel. Please note the host sat people at tables who just walked in, older men who seemed to know the host as a friend. Total discrimination! My husband and I moved to Bethel over a year ago and frequent this place often.  I like that the menu is always changing,  but for being kid friendly, the kid's menu stinks.   Not every kid eats Dino nuggets or burgers.  A little innovation would be nice since the adult menu is always so interesting.  We enjoy the fact there is music most evenings when the doors are open to the outdoors.  It reminds us of many places in Europe with the outdoor seating. Haven't been here in quite awhile but now I understand why. Received a gift card for Christmas and was actually excited about visiting,I was wrong. The salads took forever sand they were wilted and served on hot plates. It looked like yesterday's salad. Glass had a chip in it. Dinner was worse. Husband ordered lobster ravioli and he had about 6 small ravioli on his plate. He ate it like an appetizer. I ordered the salmon pasta. Salmon was well done and dry and the pasta was overcooked. This dish would have been better served cold. They also kept trying to load us up on bread since the food was taking so long. We were served the wrong dishes at first.Bravo is just washed out and played out. Don't visit here. Good when first opened years ago but gone downhill. Seems like they need new cooks and management to revive the place. Bathrooms were dirty and messy too. The last review last month about the bathroom, yep it's still that way. Nothing's been fixed. Won't be going back anytime soon. They have many varieties of wings and they were very good.  Even with the 20 min ride home, they were still crisp and flavorful.  I expected a huge wait because it was right before the Steeler -Kansas City playoff game, but they were prepared.  Great wings. we had the hot and sweet and the garlic butter parm.....yummy.  Will be back. One of the best wings in town. Many sauces to choose from. The garlic sticks are the best I have ever had. Not too much garlic and crispy. The location and quality of food are the only reasons I would recommend this Eat n Park. Saturday morning breakfast dates have become a routine for my family, and we try to pick different establishments. We had a 15 minute wait for a table which isn't the end of the world, but the service has taken a nose dive, when I have to compare other EnP locations to this one. Our server seemed disorganized, and like she was having a hard time keeping up with her section.\nOur food was good, it's really hard to mess up breakfast food, my sunny side eggs could've been cooked a little longer so I wasn't eating raw egg whites, but my waffle, and bacon were cooked well. I'm not one to complain about the small things, so I let it slide when I had to wait for a refill on iced tea, and having our missing salt shaker replaced. The server stopped by a total of twice, and took forever to stop at her other tables.\nOnce we had our check, no one was at either register. Why have two registers if no one is around? Customers are waiting in line to pay, and there's no system to the madness, so no one knows which register to wait in line at. \nThis location is only good for a few reasons, customer service isn't one of them. I have always has absolutely amazing service at this location. The food never takes a crazy amount of time to receive. My drink never reaches half empty before another is brought. The servers are all friendly and have smiles on their faces. I always order the same thing.. Crispy chicken crispers.. sides are corn on the cob and homestyle fries. I usually sub out the fries for steamed broccoli. The chipotle sauce is a perfect addition to the crispers. Chili's is one of favorite places to go when we are out that way because of the service. Lawwwd knows I love Market District for their variety and convenience. I like this location because of its proximity to my office. \n\nThis location has a Starbucks and ample space to dine in, spread out, study or just chill. It's a clean space with a bunch of helpful folks who are always willing to help you out by answering a question. \n\nI think one of the biggest areas that gets overlooked is their self-serve spice section. This place has just about every spice you can think of to create a great dish. They also have a massive self-serve candy section as well. Please do yourself a favor and check them out. \n\nThey have an amazing health and beauty section that offers hand-cut soaps, middle of the line beauty products such as NYX and always seem to carry a few independent type brands.  Perusing the aisles are fun after wrapping up grocery shopping and before hitting the check outs. \n\nI'm not going to repeat the same things that have already been shared about Market District. It's an amazing place that caters to everyone. One of the best pizza places in Pittsburgh!! I love the cheese and toppings underneath it! Always hot and fresh when I order Mineo's has the reputation for being one of the better pizza places in Pittsburgh. I've always heard good things about their pizza, but never got around to going to Mineo's before. I decided to finally stop in and give it a try to see how good it really was. I got two slices of Sicilian pizza and a small drink for lunch and the total came out to be $7.25 (just remember that Mineo's is cash only.) The pizza had a good combination of sauce, bread, and cheese. It was quite filling as well. Their pizza is delicious and I was able to get in and out for a quick lunch. Overall, I'd say Mineo's is a pretty good place to grab a slice (or a whole pie.) Graham's is such a friendly place - and they make the very best cakes. I have three children and we always get their birthday cakes or cupcakes from Graham's. People always ask where our cake is from because it is so moist and delicious. They always make exactly what I want and it is ready when I need it. Well run and feels like Pittsburgh. You won't be disappointed. I walked in at 2:30 pm on a day that it was snowing.  Not exactly rush hour.  The person behind the counter was on the phone and continued to stay on the phone for at least five minutes.  Apparently the rest of the workers aren't qualified to wait on anyone...so I waited. Ordered a dozen doughnuts and a couple of cannoli. The doughnuts are made of poor quality flour.  It's pretty hard to screw up a doughnut....but they managed to do so. The cannoli was so bad that 80% of it went into the garbage.  I will not be going back to this place.  They can do so much better...and furthermore I would be shocked if this place was still open in a year. I love their food! The salsa is nice & chunky like I prefer. The prices are fair. The service is always good. The lunch menu is even wonderful too. I know that I'll be back! Love this place!  The food is always delicious and beautifully prepared.\nLove the table side guacamole!  So glad that there is finally a good Mexican restaurant in my area. I was asked to go to meet friends, would never pick this place on my own & not going back. My friends were there before me and they each ordered a margarita they complained because there was almost no alcohol in them! For a huge drink costing well over $10 they expected a little more since one of them is a former bartender and watched him make the drinks. The bartender remade them and was given grief about it by the manager. When I came in I ended up ordering one and they gave me one of the rejected ones they didn't really hide it very well we could see plain as day. \nThe food was cold and lackluster there are so many other choices in the area skip this place! Oh and I came home and went to bed sick. Very nauseated and I shudder thinking about my experience there. Watery salsa. Ugh. One star only because you can't have zero. I asked my waitress what their quiche of the day was and she rattled off a few, I asked for the 4 cheese and she basically insisted I try the Philly cheese steak....I think they had to get rid of it or something. since she was so insistent, I ordered it and a side of bacon, Which I requested extra crispy. The quiche was dry, very chewy, had no seasoning and the crust was soggy...I think they left it in the microwave too long. The fruit that came with it had 4 tiny strawberry slices, 3 slices of banana a few small pieces of melon and 4 grapes...the potatoes were not worth eating and the bacon...well, I guess that they couldn't microwave long enough.  My waitress, after insisting I order garbage, was no where to be found...she never came back to the table until I asked another server to please get my check....then she finally came back and brought a box for my mostly uneaten breakfast. She never once asked if there was something wrong with the food. I gave her the money for the check and she disappeared again for almost 10 minutes..she came back and advised me she took so long because she was chatting with another table of people she knew....great. I boxed the food up, told her it was awful but she was welcome to take the leftovers since she suggested that it was so delicious. Again, no apology or anything. I like the Bobs in Carnegie and on Grove Road....but Painters Run....just BAD! This was my 2nd visit there and both were a waste of money. Too many other great breakfast places around to waste money on a location with bad food and horrible service. I used to live in Regent Square and continue to refer to the area as 'my favorite neighborhood in Pittsburgh' so I was excited to check out Ease, which occupies the former Dunning's space on S. Braddock.  The space still reminds you of it's former occupant, however, it has been modernized and updated nicely.  \n\nI went with a friend over holiday break and while the place had diners, I wouldn't call it overly busy.  My biggest complaint of the evening is that we were sat at a table that was smack between two other tables and did not allow you, or the neighboring tables, to push your chair out even an inch without smacking into the person behind you.  That will need to fixed because it makes for a very uncomfortable dining experience.  \n\nOur waitress was definitely on the ball and we didn't have to wait long for drinks.  Wine prices were reasonable and I believe there was a nice selection of beers.\n\nFor dinner I had the wing special which had a trio of different seasonings.  One option was a sun dried tomato rub.  Very different and I enjoyed it.  I also had their baked brie, which was tasty.  \n\nI need to come back and try one of the main dinner entrees and I think I'll be more impressed.  I met the chef/owner while there and chatted with him for a while and it is obvious he is very passionate about his menu and wants to succeed, which I want to see happen as well.  Because, after all, Regent Square is the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh! I've been searching for a \"go to \" place in my neighborhood for sometime now. EASE is Another try to establish an eatery in Edgewood. I so wish they would get a good  one. EASE is an average place with average food. Ho hum. \n\nMy coworker and I had lunch here an ordered the poutine as an appetizer. Then ordered the meatloaf sandwich and crab cake salad.\n\nFirst the poutine was rather tater tots with some pulled pork, a little bit of cheese and a bit of BBQ sauce drizzle. What makes anyone thinks that this could be considered poutine?!? No gravy! The tots were ok but dry and we had to ask for extra BBQ sauce just to finish them.\n\nThe meatloaf was ok, nothing to write home about. \n\nThe crab cake salad. Well, the crab cake was actually tasty, but the salad was an odd mixture of flavors that just did nothing to compliment each other. We asked for some extra sauce for the crab cake because the dressing in the salad was odd and took away from the decent flavors of the crab. In hindsight, we should have just ordered the crab cake and nothing else. \n\nService was friendly and fairly efficient, but they were not busy so I suppose it may have been a different story had it been busy because we only saw 1 waiter the entire time we were there. \n\nOver all it was somewhat disappointing for me, but my coworker said she liked it. Ergo the 3 star rating. Lucky my coworkers opinion was taken into consideration for this review. \n\nThe search continues..... Such great food, even better customer service. This is by far my favorite Pizza place in the south hills. The food is always good but the hostess and is a bit standoff-ish. She's not very friendly and seems rushy. So im writing this review after my second experience at this establishment. My party was greeted by Alex, who took 100% excellent care of us. His \"table side\" manner was probably  the best I've ever seen, drinks were also quickly attended to. Our chef Adi was hands down the best in the pittsburgh area\n Im sure people say that alot but I am serious he is not only highly entertaining, his cooking style and seasoning is untouched from what I have seen. If you are looking for a great entertainment dinner/lunch you need to check this place out. Great entertainment and wonderful food everytime!! In Pittsburgh for work...\n\nMy wife had the moussaka which came with a house salad. The salad alone was huge with tons of fresh feta, Greek olives and an amazing house dressing.\n\nI went with the Greek Benedict. Awesome.\n\nGuarantee...You won't go home hungry! And good luck trying to finish your meal with one of their incredible deserts...we took some back to the hotel for a late night calorie binge. Stopped  in for breakfast and had the western. Portions were huge and tasted great. However., with only on waitress on duty in a very busy environment the service sucked. I had to wait  quite a while and then had to flag her down for a water refill. I never did get a coffee refill. Every few weeks, I pop into Aladdin's to grab some hummus, lentil soup, and their super tasty chicken chili. One of the many reasons to love Aladdin's is the low guilt factor. They seem to use great ingredients and The nutritional information always looks positive. There's rarely room for dessert, but they have incredible looking treats on display. Stopped here for lunch while touring the Mt. Lebanon business district.  I was greeted and seated promptly. I did learn the following upon arrival: Yelp is offering a $10.00 voucher for $5.00 if you wish to purchase it. I'm always for good deals so that was a great savings. Also, they do not validate garage parking if you parking in one of Mt. Lebanon's indoor garages.\n\nThe menu is vast and extensive but my waiter was kind enough to explain the choices to me and help me come up with a decision. I opted for the chicken tender salad that came with cucumbers, grapes, and cranberries to name a few. This is a Mediterranean style restaurant so you can get a lot of meatless sandwiches and flatbreads. \n\nYour are served a basket of pita bread but nothing to dip it with. I inquired about that and learned that if I wanted hummus or anything else for that matter then it would cost me around $3.95. I politely declined. To me, that is like serving you a basket of bread without butter and then charging you for the butter.\n\nMy salad came in record time and I was indeed pleased with both the presentation as well as the taste. It wasn't overfilling but enough for me. They have as you enter a case displaying various cakes if you want for dessert but I decided to pass on that one.\n\nAnother item of note is that when I went to the ladies room I noticed they have two toilets but neither of them have private stall coverings. Although they are not side by side, still it could pose a bit of a problem for women.\n\nWith the savings of $10.00 I actually in the long run was glad that they could shave $5.00 off my check.  Aladdin's is a chain so you will find it in other parts of the city. This is the first time I ever visited one and may check a different one out in my travels. I have never eaten here however, I have attempted to at least 4 times.  The Hot and Ready Pizza is NEVER ready.  4 times I have tried to grab a pizza here.  They always quote me 10 minutes.  If I wanted to wait 10 minutes for a pizza, I sure as hell wouldn't be ordering Little Caesars.  \n\nSo I usually leave and call in an order somewhere else.  If I'm waiting 10, might as well wait 15-20 somewhere better. The hot dogs (I prefer the Angry Tiki) are the best I've ever had, but surprisingly, this establishment has become my go-to pizza shop in Regent Square. \n\nPrices for pizza are incredibly reasonable, and the Texas BBQ never fails to disappoint. I don't drink, but the beer cave is no doubt very impressive for beer fans.\n\nMy only negative would be how packed the place gets when the bar crowd rolls in, but if we're ordering dinner, we just take it to go. I'm assuming the crowd would be a positive for some people, so I'm not going to bother taking a star off for it.\n\nGood hot dogs, good pizza, good wings, good sweet potato fries. D's is what's up. D's is a neighborhood classic. They're known for the hot dogs, pizza, and bottle beer selection. I'd say they are like Primanti's. They're typically good, but not a place to take foodies (Franktuary would be the foodie hot dog joint).\n\nThe hot dogs are pretty good. If you look at the pictures, it's primarily hot dogs. The french frie servings are huge (but not Oakland O huge). Pizza is good. I'd recommends staying aware from the other options. I haven't been impressed with the hoagies and wings.\n\nAs a note, be careful with some of the bottles. I've had some old ones on occasion when I've picked some of the odder selections. That being said, this would be my pick for a bottle bar. They don't have the massive Belgian selection that is Sharp Edge, but the service is 10x better. Everyone knows about D's right? It's the place in Regent Square where you can buy 1000 different kinds of beers for all over the place by the bottle. Such a nice selection to choose from and you can even make your own six pack to take home with you. The also of course have hotdogs and many different kinds (or you can create your own). You can pick the kind of dog as well as what toppings it has (and there are a lot).\n\nThere are three sections to this place, the bar, the restaurant, and the beer cave. I've bene to all three and they are all worth a visit, especially the beer cave! Large grocery store with a small state store attached. Gluten-free area. Dietz and Watson deli meats. Large salad bar. This is the second time I have come for lunch and I have the place to myself-- which is ok for me, but too bad for you! The soups are homemade excellent- just had the chicken and dumpling. So good. Now on to the famous pierogis which are tops. Ok, Starlight isn't trendy/swank but that's just another plus in its appeal column. I consider a place like Starlight a treasure where more and more, places like it are being replaced by chain crap. Do yourself a favor - come here, get some real food done well at an awesome price, and ditch the fast food and the not-so fast food places that make the food in Omaha or somewhere, freeze it (last year) so it can be fresh-microwaved today. 1/7/2017 stopped and ate with my family (2 kids and hubby).  Total bill was under 40.00.  Food was fresh and very good. I'll come back when on this side of town. It was our favorite place for years but after tonight, I doubt we will ever go back. The seafood fried noodle was awful. The fried noodles were like they had been left out for days, the rest was bland no flavor. The egg foo young was the best but only rate 2 stars. For $125 in food, most went into the garbage. I love this coffee shop it is my favorite in the area. The coffee selection is great there smoothies are very good. I love the nitro cold brew.. even when it's a artic out here. The staff is very friendly. And they pay attention to a lot of details like using frozen coffee cubes as ice cubes so your coffee doesn't dilute. I have a lot of gluten free and vegan pastry options as well super yummy. Check them out!! Most of our food was wonderful and I loved the ambiance. The chicken was WAY overcooked, but the glaze made it tolerable. The mashed potatoes were super bland. The service was okay most of the time, but the guys had a hard time getting refills for their beers. If it were closer, I might go back, but it's not really worth going out of my way. Loved Luma! We went during restaurant week but only one of us ordered from the special menu. I had the she crab soup and stuffed salmon and my boyfriend had the grilled cheese dippers, filet medallions with pasta, and the chocolate saucy dessert. Everything was delicious! Great portions and great prices regardless of restaurant week. We will definitely be back! We saw this on the restaurant week lineup, and decided to try it, it was a new place for us. Luma is a bit of the beaten path in Mt Lebanon, but worth the search. It's a smallish place, maybe 20 - 25 tables, and very busy, even after eight on a cold, rainy weeknight; I suggest reservations. My girlfriend really liked the house red, and both of us enjoyed our food, delivered well by the wait staff.  We love to try new places during restaurant week, and we'll be coming back to Luma. I enjoyed Luma very much. I had the lunch salad with a crab cake. The salad dressing was delicious. I'd buy it if they bottled it. The greens were fresh and cold. My companion had the chopped salad and it was also very good. It's a very small place but has a full bar. There are linen table cloths and napkins. The server was friendly and attentive. I think the prices are higher than they should be. I will go back for a special occasion. My co-workers and I come here for lunch several times a week. The wait staff has come to know us and do all they can to help us speed through the lunch break, since we get only 45 minutes! \n\nThe food is terrific, especially the French fries! And we all love the homemade ranch dressing. \n\nThey have a lunchtime loyalty program, and if you go on your birthday, you get to spin the wheel for a variety of prizes! Lots of fun and great food . . .what more could you ask for? Don't bother eating in, you're not missing out...unless staring at uncleared tables is your thing. Just call in your pizza(s), etc. and pick it up. It's hard to stand out in the packed pizza world, but Gino Bros is a solid 'go to' option in the Harmarville/Oakmont area. I came here for a business lunch with two teammates. \n\nOur server (Mathew) greeted us immediately after being seated and was the perfect amount of attentive without being clingy.  He refilled our drinks regularly and without being asked.  He was extremely polite.\n\nThe food was good.  The rosemary bread that they serve before the meal was warm and very tasty.  I had the lunch special with a ceasar salad to start and stuffed shrimp scampi as the entr\u00e9e.  The salad was delicious; a little more tart and fresh than a normal ceasar.  The shrimp was pretty good.  There are 4 stuffed shrimp to a lunch order and it was served with a bit of a vegetable medley and rice.  Overall, pretty tasty!\n\nIt isn't the cheapest place around but it is great for a business lunch. Food was very good and prepared as I had asked. The service at the bar was another thing.  No utensils when appetizer was delivered no bread and never asked. More concerned on watching the TV  and if I ever needed anything else. May need to try the dining room next time IF I return Fantastic food - best wings & bread bites ever!!!  Fast, friendly service - one of our favorite places!!! Came here on a Wednesday night and surprisingly there was a 30 minute wait. We walked around but there really aren't many shops left in the galleria worth going in. \n\nI ordered the heartland grilled chicken salad and my friend ordered the buffalo blue chicken salad. The heartland salad was ok nothing special. Grilled chicken, red bell pepper, pecans, cheddar, croutons and garlic ranch. There was barely any dressing so I asked for more on the side. \n\nFor dessert, we had the mini fried chocolate donuts. They were freshly made and delicious. Can't beat a crispy warm donut covered in sugar. Overall nothing special, a standard chain with mediocre food. Had dinner there last night.  Absolutely delicious. We had Calamari, French Onion soup, the Kansas City Hamburger, loaded baked potato, Oriental Chopped salad.  Everything was prepared perfectly. Great flavors.  Excellent service. It has been years since I last dined at Rico's Restaurant. While visiting from FL over the holidays, I returned to my old favorite after my nephew's HS Basketball game. \nThe appetizers were amazing! French Fried Zucchini, Signature Angel Hair Pasta. And Jumbo Lump Crabmeat were flawlessly executed. Owner David Lorenzini was warm and very friendly. The legendary Rico was eating dinner with David. I got to meet and speak with him. Exciting! \nSalads and entrees were also first class. Finished with Pittsburgh classic Pecan Ball with Hot Fudge. \nA great time in a Pittsburgh institution. \nI look forward to returning! Ordered delivery of two calzones here.. we live right around the corner from this location and it took an hour to get the food delivered. I wouldn't mind that but I ordered the gyro calzone and one with pepperoni and sausage, mushrooms and onions. I guess they forgot the meat because each calzone only had onions in it and the one had mushrooms. I liked how cheesy they were but that was about it. I probably won't be ordering from here again. Best sushi in the area at a great price!! Friendly staff. Amazing spicy Thai curry and great sushi combos. Been going here for years and it is always good. A quiet place right outside the city. Friend and I found this place randomly and we were satisfied with it. We both had the classic Pho Tai. I'm usually really skeptical about most pho places, but this one had really flavorful broth and huge portions. The sliced beef was the only think I was iffy about. It ended up being slightly dry despite it. For the price I would say this place was decent. This is probably the worst restaurant that I have been to in the last year.  Just about everything was below par.  We found a hair in the Tom yum soup.  The chicken in two dishes tasted like it was on the edge.  The tuna sashimi was about the only thing that was decent.  This place is not clean.  The carpet was filthy in the middle of the afternoon.  Avoid. MMMMMM. I was worried since I couldn't find a decent ramen place in the south Pittsburgh area (within a 30 minutes drive) that my Pho loving taste buds would receive yet another devastating blow. Pho Kim 88 does not disappoint. Not only do they serve Vietnamese cuisine but other oriental yum yums as well like Japan and Thailand. The dumplings are delicious, their Popping Boba Tea takes about 15 minutes to make so call ahead if it's for pick up, the Thai Tom Kha (spicy coconut milk seafood soup) is too amazing for words, both the fresh and fried spring rolls do not disappoint, their rolls although pricey are delicious, and the Pho tastes similar to my hometown's which I accept. \n\nI cannot give this place 5 stars though for the service. I don't mind the service with little to no smiles but when I did dine in our waitress was not quick to fill out our water no did she come to check on us for quite some time after the meal was delivered. It was not a busy lunch hour so I had to bump them a star. \n\nOverall, I am happy to have a decent Vietnamese restaurant down the street from my work. I still need to try new places to get a better idea but Pho Kim 88 is just so convenient and good that I may never venture out. It's definitely worth it to give the place a try. This location is hit or miss. I have been several times. The food/service is not consistent. Also the design of store is very poor. If a few people are in front of you in line you may be forced to stand in the vestibule. Other Panera locations have plenty of outlets for you to recharge and do some work if need be. This location outlets very few and far between. Going to keep this review short and sweet. My last visit I ordered a Thai salad to go. Got home and within the first few bites found not one, not two, but multiple bugs floating in my salad. I wrote an email complaint to corporate and got a response 4 days later from a manager saying she can't help me because this isn't her store. Really lady??\n\nSoup is always Luke warm or cold. Never hot. Your bill will be about $15-20 for one person and nearly $30 for two. It's not worth the price, hassle, or wait times. \n\nKeep your money and go elsewhere. Let's put this Panera out of business. I will never return!! I'll start by saying this review is specifically for this Panera at McCandless Crossing.  After doing some investigating, it's a franchised store and apparently this franchise just doesn't give a rat's behind.  I've had plenty of good experiences with Panera, so I don't want to overgeneralize.\n\nFirst, whoever designed this store should never work again.  You can fit like three people in line before everyone's having to stand out the door, weaving here and there to let people out.  On to the real issue, though.  This store is the closest to my house and we've tried repeatedly to pick up orders to go there.  Every time we get home and realize that multiple parts of the order are wrong.  We've taken to trying to remember each time to check the bag and have them fix the mistakes before we leave, but there are times when you're just in a rush and don't end up doing that part of their job for them.  Today we had multiple parts of our order wrong, and the manager was the one packing the order!  When we got home and realized that the sandwich was the wrong sandwich and the salad was just plain missing from the bag, the \"manager\" said I could either come down and get a free pastry or get a free \"you pick 2 coupon\" in the mail.  They've had to give me coupons before, and quite frankly, I would much rather just get a correct order than have to  be offered a stupid coupon every time I come to the store.  I will drive to Wexford or down to McKnight if I want Panera; this place has been like this since they've opened and there's no excuse any more.  They're relying off of the popularity of McCandless Crossing but refusing to actually make their restaurant a better run operation.  Panera, keep an eye on your franchises: I'm reasonable enough to realize that this one store shouldn't represent the company as a whole, but not everyone's so understanding. It was a steelers gameday, not packed at all. Ordered the meatball hoagie with fries and the chicken parm sandwich. The fries were crispy and tasty. The meatball hoagie was really nicely made, enough meatballs and cheese and sauce as well. I would recommend it. The chicken parm sandwich comes open faced on toasted garlic bread which was different but tasted awesome that way. Good draft choices and service at the bar was quick and cordial. I went for the first time today, and I'd have to say it was great. The service was quick and I did not wait long for my food. I got the buttermilk pancakes with butter and syrup and they were really good. For dessert I got a sundae that was also quite good. I had surprisingly never gone to a Denny's before and I would say it was a good experience. The food here is good, I've been coming here since I was a child and I never once had a bad experience. Great atmosphere, friendly staff. I was torn between crab and tacos and the waitress asked the chef to make me crab tacos. They were amazing! I gotten cakes from Signature Desserts on two occasions. The first was a fresh strawberry cake for a birthday. The birthday girl loved it. The second was on my most recent visit for a carrot cake for a party. Everyone raved about the cake. The cake didn't really stay together well though. This could be partly due to it not being refrigerated like the box said. Anyways. They're not the cheapest cakes but they are definitely fresh and delicious. We order delivery from Pizza Roma at least once a week. Pizza is excellent, price is reasonable and delivery is always fast. They are one of the few places that does a very good sicilian style but their traditional is excellent as well. Thank you Restaurant Week!  We live 3 miles away from La Capella and did not know it existed. What a find. The lasagna was homemade- just like Mama's. This is no small thing...Mama was born in Italy!  The service was fast and friendly. Our server was Genny and she was most helpful. She was always one step ahead.  We will be back! So I love the bar. However I had a visa gift card from Christmas that I could not use. Not cool After 5 years I have acknowledged that the inconsistent quality food is not worth it. Once among the best, I am giving up. Food & Service was outstanding.  Will stop back for wings.  Linda had the pizza and I had the tuna fish sandwich   I can't wait for leftover pizza tonight \nPatrick R This location is good most of the time. The drive through people are friendly and the service is usually swift. Occasionally they are out of the bagel that I want but otherwise they are fine. Nicely organized and huge selection of goods. The prices are far more reasonable than other stores. I like the produce section. The vegetables are always fresh. Fun atmosphere and fast service!  I went here on New Year's Day and we had the two nephews with us all.  So we all know how dining with kids is.  They greeted us and got our food to us pretty fast.  I created my own burger and it reminded me of The Counter in Los Angeles! Loved it!!! Really good food. Large menu selection. Very clean and wonderful, quick service. Only downside is that it is quite on the pricy side. Excellent food and service every time that I have been here.  Normally get the Crab Shack or Meat Your Maker.  Both are amazing. Wife and I did the build your own burger option.  I got the Waygu beef with carmalized onion marmalade, spinach, red onions, truffle  something aoili, smoked gouda cheese and a rub that I cant remember.  Not that it matters because it was the best burger I've had in a very long time.  Based on the outside I expected a bit more upscale atmosphere but glad it wasn't.  The prices were a little high, but you should expect as much, it's no McDonalds.  \n\nWe did get the potato salad side option which was a little disappointing but by no means bad.  It's a shame we don't have one close as we're from out of state and werr visiting family.  We'll definitly have to make this a thing though. Another great burger place- very similar to BRGR with the build your own burger and spiked shakes (I prefer BRGR shakes). I've been three times and it's always been very busy. Service is very quick and polite though. They offer a gluten free bun and are available to answer questions on the menu. I would say that I was able to order from about 50% of the menu (which I see as good odds). The atmosphere at this location, from my experience, has been very loud and crowded, so if you're looking for a quiet dinner or if you want to hear everyone in your group, I would go somewhere else. Best bar in Swissvale. Tons of space in both the bar and dining room (and a separate smoking area behind a glass door, can't smell it anywhere). Beer is super cheap, solid selection, and the specials during Pens and Steelers games on Miller Lite are great. Dollar off drinks during happy hour too. \n\nBut the food! Man it's good. The pizza is great, the crust is the best I've had in Pittsburgh. Tons of veggie options. Homemade chips are killer with their honey mustard. \n\nLove that they have trivial pursuit cards on the bar. AMI jukebox. Tons of parking. Good TV's.  Can't beat it. For some reason we'd driven past GoodFellas daily ever since it opened but only recently made our way in. Since visiting this GoodFellas last week, we've already been back. We LOVE this place. It checks all the boxes for us. It is smoke-free which I love. BUT, we also have friends who smoke. Fret not! there is an indoor smoking area for them which I sincerely appreciate! And it's located so far from the bar that you can't smell it at all. The food is awesome. In a time when bone marrow entrees have replaced any vegetarian options, this place has stood it's ground. There are a wide variety of options for carnivores but I can't remember the last time I had so many selections as a vegetarian. There are TWO vegetarian burgers, a few eggplant dishes, pizza, grilled cheese and a few other things I can't remember. It seems too good to be true! The two dishes I've tried so far (Quinoa burger and eggplant hoagie) have been delicious! There's a solid beer selection, standards like Miller, Labatt, etc. but also a decent selection of craft beers (Full Pint, Green Flash, Rogue, Fat Heads, Etc.). All the beer is reasonably priced. The scene is pretty solid. Lots of locals. Look forward to getting to know some of them. Some of the guys seem like total riffraff but you'll get that anywhere. Anyways, overall, can't recommend this place enough. Looking forward to many, many future visits. Oh and the women's bathroom is the best I've ever seen. First clue was  just a few people at the bar no one in dinning area\n\n1. Taps are bad I exchanged it for a bottle beer\n\n\n2.Says fresh hand breaded fish it was just a frozen patty\nI read reviews from others about there fish sandwich \n\nI guess I went when they ran out of fresh fish I always stop by Here to get tacos. Taste good and fast service. What more can you ask for! Ever since this location opened up, we go here instead of driving up to the Longhorn in Cranberry Township, farther North. This location produces consistently good food and service. We have never had to send back any steak due to errors in cooking. The servers are a bit more relaxed and confident in Cranberry, but they're certainly professional at this location. Cranberry is still my favorite, but there is absolutely nothing wrong to report with the McCandless locale, and Longhorn blows Outback out of the water menu to menu.\n\nVisited December 2016 I love the food at this restaurant.  Every dish is very fairly priced and also tasty.  The pizza is also something you should try. Great food.  But we had a SUPER Server Amber. She gave us just the attention we needed.. noted that my wifes  steak wrap was not cooked medium as ordered and offered to make it right.  refills of coffee and pop when needed without asking. Nice music on the sound system.  clean friendly relaxing. we liked it. I'll be back New owners and sadly I need to update my original review.   Maybe I'm spoiled from original owners but it's no longer the same as we struggled to find sushi that was not tempura/fried.  Its not horrible, just not great...  Service leaves a bit to be desired as well.  Sadly I will be looking for a new place for sushi. this store is #$%&@* huge. oh my goodness. \n\nWhile in Robinson we decided to stop in and grab something for dinner. This isn't my first time at this market district, but it was my first time personally shopping (my last visit I was just with someone).\n\nThe store has a great selection of everything. Their produce section itself is amazing. Don't even get me started on all the cheese they have to offer.\n\n In their beer area, they have an entire bar! I wouldn't think it'd be busy, but there was an entire bar full of folks just chilling.. drinking their beer or cup of wine. I may head here to grocery shop.. buzzed off of wine while doing the awful task of grocery shopping sounds like an epic plan!\n\nWhile being a big store may seem like all positives.. its not. For example, I forgot to get bananas. I remembered while in line... but walking a gazillion feet back over the produce seem so far away that I just decided not too.\n\nanyways not bad. they also have a space of kids to go while parents shop. Most GE's took out that feature. Definitely my favorite Chinese restaurant. They made is feel like friends. Chef sent out a surprise that was awesome. Orange chicken was the best, as usual. Tried something new, walnut shrimp, it was excellent and we would order it again. Great service and great management. Been dining here for years and are always very pleased with the quality and the service.  We do a mix of dine in, takeout and delivery and I have to say, the delivery service is always fast and efficient.  Great tasting  sushi with a vast selection-- the homemade ginger dressing is the best! Terrible food. The beef I order was hard and hard to eat. Not to mention, the amount of oil that was in my food. Later I got sick because of it. I wouldn't recommend this place. I've been ordering delivery for here a few months now and have not been disappointed. Everything I've ordered has been outstanding. The handmade dumplings are good. The chicken lo mein is good and the fried rice is some of the best I've eaten. Everyone I've dealt with on the phone has been very helpful and all the delivery guys have been very friendly. This has become my go to for Chinese in Mt. Lebanon Love this place! Great atmosphere and service! Our food and drink were great! We will be back! So yummy!! Best ice cream ever I wish they had one closer to my house! The employees were awesome too!  5 stars! I came here for a day lunch date with my friend and we had an awesome time. We sat at the bar, had great service the entire time and really enjoyed our food and drinks. We tried about 8 different beers from BJ's and I liked them all! Their seasonal double IPA was super delicious, and their stouts were really tasty as well. For food, we ordered a couple small items- the fried portabella strips appetizer, the Brussels sprouts appetizer and a small Hawaiian pizza with habanero added (the bartenders recommendation). Everything was great- the portabella strips were juicy and the sauce that came with them were so complimenting. The Brussels sprouts were just as good, although I would have preferred if the sauce came on the side, rather than them swimming in the sauce. Regardless, the sauce was REALLY tasty. The pizza was super delicious, although I didn't really notice a spicy kick at all from the habanero. Just when I thought we were done eating, my friend ordered the ahi tuna appetizer. This was the first time I had ever tried raw tuna... and I really liked it. It was fresh, and the portion was pretty generous as well. Overall- we really enjoyed our afternoon here and I am looking forward to coming back for dinner sometime. So ok, it's a holiday and people are off, but one bartender during a heavy lunch service is ridiculous. And he is doing the best he can no doubt, but shame on BJ's. \nand he is really good. Mgt must have their heads up their ass as usual at restaurants. \nFood, very good. I had unlimited soup and salad. I had chili, broccoli cheese, and a wedge. All very enjoyable. I've been to this restaurant 3 times.  I hope I don't have to go back again. The service is consistently bad, the food takes forever to be delivered to the table (45+ minutes average) and the food is average at best.  I honestly don't know why there is always a wait to get a seat. Nice chain restaurant tucked away in McCandless Crossing. American fare with very little imagination.  If you're a beer drinker then BJ's was built with you in mind.  Little impressed me about their food selection, but they have an enormous beer/cider selection.  Not being much of a drinker, the best I could muster was three stars. The waitstaff wasn't great, the food was unimaginative, but what I ate tasted pretty good.  They did mediocre exceptionally well.\n\nGood for groups, kids, but the parking is awful.  They share a lot with a grocery store and another restaurant. Expect to walk a pretty good distance from your car to the door, and if it's calling for rain - bring an umbrella.  It's a hike. A+ for the hostess but a big F for the server who never greeted us.  My family and I went on New Years Day and had two little kids with us.  The hostess alerted our server twice about us and he still never came up to us.  Waited about ten minutes then walked out.  This place was not busy either! Pretty sad because I have loved BJs on the west coast. We get take out often from here, and the menu is sort of hit and miss for take out.  \n\nSo far, we have found that the deep dish pizza, the tortilla soup, the pot stickers, the burgers, the chicken lettuce wraps, and the root beer ribs are great!  \n\nNot so great - wings of any kind (always soggy!) and the flat bread pizza (does not travel well).\n\nI love their homemade cream sodas too! Went there with 6, place was dead, server never showed up so we complained to the hostess. She said something to him and he walked the other way so we left and are now at Burgatory!\n\nUpdate:  Burgatory was AMAZING!  It was awful to have to remove my party (including two kids 4 & 1) across the street but well worth it.  I've been to this restaurant before, and the food is pretty good, but the competition in the area is a lot better. Updating my review to two stars based on previous visit, because I am less irritated as Burgatory filled me up, but I won't be back again. Too many better options around that actually want your business. This review is just about the food at BJ's as we got it to go. I have eaten inside as well and the service was normal in attention and speed. \n\nWe got the avocado egg rolls for appetizer and that tasted strange to me - not off but just having avocado in a dish that was warmer seemed strange to me like it needed to be eaten chilled. The taste of the avocado egg rolls was not to my liking, either, not being able to make out the avocado and chicken components. I also got the in-house root beer which I rate at 6 our of 10 on my scale, and it had a strong licorice flavor.\n\nFor entrees, my husband got the baked ziti and that is just as you'd expect with a nice flavor to the tomato sauce and a nice bite to the pasta. I ordered the fish and chips and it came with string fries which were very good. The breading was light and the fish had a great flavor. I will be ordering that again. \n\nFinally, for dessert we ordered the peanut butter pizookie as I've had it before and it's always delicious. We were there late after bowling with a party of 13. We called the day before to reserve a table. They had some customers but not crowded. The waitress was friendly and did a nice job. The kitchen was VERY slow. The food came 30-45 minutes after we ordered. Not sure why it took so long. The beer selection was nice. Several unique brews. The food was good once it finally came. I would consider trying them again but others in our group won't. Too bad because we always go out after bowling and it's a big sale for the restaurant. I would give this place five stars if the service were better.  It seems like the waitstaff disappears in the back for long periods of time.  I have sat with an empty glass for more than 10 minutes more than once.  Sometimes the servers will just walk by you without checking on you and you almost have to literally grab them.\n\nThat being said, the food is always very good.  I love the tomato pepper jack soup!  The burgers are good as is the chicken parm sandwich.  They have an excellent selection of beer on tap and a fairly large menu.\n\nI really, really want them to do a better job with their waitstaff so I can bump this to five stars.  Until they get better, three is all I can do.\n\nUpdate: it seems as though the waitstaff has gotten better or they hired more.  Wait times have dropped so I bumped up another star.  By the way, I love the tomato pepper jack soup and grilled cheese for lunch! I agree with two other negative reviews. (Over 25 min (on my stop watch) )   and no soup. \nAnother couple who came in later than us got their soup and finished it before ours. We had to complain at that point.  The waitress says that their policy is to serve the soup with the sandwich bla bla bla something about 'a side'.   I have never heard of this policy in my 50 years of all resturants.  The waitress should have warned us !!!  First time I only tipped 10 percent in that time too.  Oh My wife's Cuban was a burnt crisp with hardly any meat and was so bad our dog wouldn't even have it. NEVER GOING BACK THERE EVER AND SPEADING THE BAD WORD. If you like waiting 2 hours for you food and having a cup the size of my fist then be my guest. Sat with an empty cup for over 30 minutes. By the time we got our food it was cold and very unappetizing. Don't recommend you come :( I have been spending the last week dining at places with birthday deals, lol. Benihana is no exception. They offer one of the best ones. \n\nMy bf and I decided to dine in after he found out that there was one in Pgh. He is from florida where Benihana has its headquarters and thought it was only in that state. He was surprised to find this location didn't include all glass windows while on the beach, but hey whatever. its Pittsburgh man!\n\nFor you birthday, Benihana emails you a $30 coupon. (valid Mon-Thurs) It is a great coupon considering the basic hibachi dishes are $19 and the entrees with 2 meats costs about $25-40 depending on what you get. I ordered the Benihana Delight-- chicken & shrimp. It was a '6 course meal'-- soup, salad, veggies, rice, chicken+shrimp & ice cream. My boyfriend with the chefs special, steak & lobster.\n\nOur hibachi table only had one other couple at it, so it was very nice. Bob did the cooking for us. He was kind & friendly. We made casual conversation. He didn't do any special tricks but that was probably because there were only 4 (adults) at the table. When kids are there, they seem to do more. \n\nEverything tasted really good. For dessert, I went with green tea ice cream. It was delicious. I expected a heavy flavor and to actually not like it, but it wasn't overpowering & heavy... more like refreshing. \n\nOur server disappeared during our meal despite needing refills. Eventually she did come over but then took awhile for boxes and checks. Also 2 people (including me) were celebrating birthdays and no one sang to us lol. which is a good thing but they went around to every other table. We noticed severs on their phones at a table near the door. Managers should hide them a little better lol. at least it explained where she was most of the time...\n\nI would rate 3.5 stars but I rounded up to 4 :) I took my girlfriend here last night for some sushi, we ordered a California roll, spicy tuna roll, eel roll and the sumo roll. Before the food came I ordered one of their new specialty drinks (baby Mount Fuji) and it was absolutely disgusting.The only thing we enjoyed was the spicy tuna roll. The seaweed was not holding the sushi together and every bite was a struggle. We watched the sushi chef finish two rolls and it sat there for 15 minutes before the waiter remembered to take it to his table. I can say with confidence that I will not be returning to Benihana. The waitress was too rude and was showing a lot of attitude. Never did I see an hostess behaving that way with a customer. Would never go back again. Thai Foon is the best! This place is only a few minutes away from my house and it is wonderful to go to for a quick & delicious Thai meal. I've ordered multiple meals from here. For apps, the fried dumplings and crab rangoon are so good. The entrees I have also ordered chicken pad Thai but my absolute favorite is the pho with beef. I just can't get enough of their pho! The service is always quick if you are dining in or taking out. A great spot to check out if you are in the area! Really good food but bad Service . The waitress at this place was too rude in my recent visit to this place. Don't get the chicken shawarma. Don't do it. Unless you like eating leather. I made the mistake of getting the chicken shawarma and it ended up being a waste of money because I had to throw it all away. It was so incredibly dry and chewy, as if it was cooked in the dehydrator. It might as well have been chicken jerky. I was so disappointed with the chicken. However, my sides of tabouleh and baba ganoush were decent, tasting relatively fresh. \n\nUnfortunately, the service wasn't great during my visit either. The wait time was longer than they estimated and there seemed to be a lot of confusion when placing my order. Probably won't be back. Came here with my family on Sunday afternoon.  There weren't many people there but we decided to brace it anyway.  Glad we did.  The food was reasonably priced and very good.  We had burgers and pizza.  They have a tremendous selection of beers on tap as well.  The only negative was that there was a subtle weird smell when we walked in and it was there pretty much the whole time.  Hard to describe exactly.  It wasn't terrible or overwhelming but did detract from the experience in my opinion.  I'd still probably come back. Ernest, Corey, DeVar, and Samuel were some of the most upbeat people I came across on a daily basis. It's such a shame that they have moved on. All four of those guys were a real asset to GetGo, and friendly conversations with them would always enhance my day.\n\nHopefully the new staff can do them justice. It was my first time at Atria's last evening with my boyfriend and it was all around one of the best dining experiences I've had in a while! Very unexpected! They kept it classy. The servers worked as a team and since it was my first time, the manager gave us a free sample of their fried zucchini appetizer. The zucchini was cut very thin, which I prefer, giving the dish a nice balance of tastes. My boyfriend ordered the crab bisque, crab cakes, and I ordered the pot roast along with a 1/2 priced bottle of wine (wednesday special). Everything was very good. We were very impressed with the overall experience and will be back. Great job! A wide selection of healthy foods. Was introduced in November and going back this weekend. Ordered the Salmon and Vegetable frittata, eggs overcooked, salmon in  clump on one side of frittata, no tomatoes, moms waffle arrived cold. First time we came here it was good, this time bad. Disappointing! Really disappointed in the sushi! Completely fell apart. It tasted like BBQ sauce on top of the specialty roll and the other roll had zero flavor at all. Won't be back for sushi with so many other great places in the area. Where can I start?! This is by far the best sushi place I've been to in PA.\n\nTHE ROLLS:\n-So my doctor says I can't have imitation crab as a prego lady so I've been challenged with trying to find an amazing totally cooked sushi rolls. This is a huge challenge for me considering I could probably be happy eating a fish right out of the ocean. Sashimi, nigiri, and raw rolls are the life source just beyond my reach the next 9 months, boo. I promise that I am not rambling there is a moral to this story. \n-TL;DR...Traditionally when you order a California Roll you have to request an upgrade to snow crab or real crab that usually comes with a multi dollar up-charge. At UMAI, the California roll already comes with real crab, so the sushi is delicious and NO UPCHARGE YAY! \n- For the not so fond of seafood folks, my coworker ordered the pumpkin roll which was served fresh and still slightly warm which actually made the roll delicious!\n\nOTHER FOODS:\n-Miso Soup: Miso is miso but they are not stingy on the tofu which is a big bonus.\n-Side Salad: The dressing was nice and creamy with a little tang. \n-Gyoza: It's hard to get gyoza wrong and UMAI was not one to disappoint. Great flavor!\n-Edamame: Served with a grilled onion topping. I love traditional but this is so delicious I would order it again.\n-Veggie Tempura: The batter was crispy and not over breaded, the sauce was perfect, and along with traditional vegetables there was pumpkin, asparagus, and mushrooms. YUM!\n-Shoyu Ramen: I am a Tonkotsu Ramen girl so the Shoyu didn't hit home like I wanted but it was still delicious. If you like different kinds of ramen then I suggest trying this! \n \nSERVICE: \n- Our waitress Valerie was top notch! The sushi bar can out as it was made and she didn't miss a beat. She was super sweet and attentive. \n\nAMBIANCE:\n- It's a small intimate place so make sure you go during a non-rush time to really get an untainted opinion before you try to tough the lunch rush. The owner was working the sushi bar which added a warm touch to the place. I love family owned establishments. \n\nPARKING:\n- There is meter parking in the front and sides of the strip but if you can't find a spot, try the larger meter parking lot behind the building. I had to park at the farthest spot of that lot and it was not too far to walk in my heels. Food was good. The fish tasted fresh. I ordered the Toto Roll, miso soup, and edamame, and was not disappointed. The staff was very polite; however, I give this place 4 stars only because we were the only customers in the whole place and I still had to ask for our drinks to be refilled. Went on a Sunday evening. Sat down at the bar for a good 10 minutes until we were even approached. A table had walked in 5 minutes after us and received immediate service. Finally the server came over after he had been refilling drinks for tables directly in front of us and said, \" oh did you just come in I didn't even see you\".... we should have just left after that. Instead we decided to order food. My friends food came out before mine and she even finished hers before mine came. When my food came it was not even what I ordered and the roll completely fell apart. Very bad experience. I have been going to the Red Orchid since 2012 and I have recommended it to local friends and friends visiting the city, all who have grown to love it just as much as I do. I have been to Thai restaurants along the east coast, and by far, this is the best Thai I have ever had. \n\nNot only is the food authentic as it gets, the owners and staff are so friendly that when I was going through a hard time in my personal life, the waitress who I came to know over the years hugged me and gave me so many kind words. Aside from that they have expanded! They now have a liquor license and they are better than ever. \n\nDishes I would recommend: \nGreen Curry-To DIE for. The green curry has broccoli and the most perfect coconut milk in it with a side of rice. All the curries are delicious,  but this is my favorite. Get a level 1-2 spicy if you are beginner with Thai cuisine. \n\nDrunken noodles- My second favorite dish. I must have ordered this dish 30 times over the past few years. The noodles are thin, wide, and so flavorful. I love the bean sprouts, green and red peppers, as well as the chicken I add. \n\nSpicy Tom Yum Soup- My sister's favorite! It's really creamy, yet has the perfect balance of spiciness and flavor. Normally wouldn't order a soup for an entree but it really is filling. \n\nDrink- Can't go wrong with a Thai iced tea. I wouldn't get an entree without it. It's sweet and balances out the spiciness from the entree. \n\nMango with sticky rice- A light, yet divine dessert to a wonderful meal. \n\nOverall, my favorite restaurant has never failed me or my friends/ acquaintances. I would recommend it to anyone! Damn great pizza joint!! Ordered delivery many times then got a pick up,  very clean and new. Love the classic Italian hoagie (dressing on the side)!! Nice menu with value of choices.  Very happy with new owners, they really did what was necessary to revamp the place. My go-to pizza order place now.  \n\nBOB N. makes the greatest pizza in the Burgh!!! Best Jamaican food in the burgh. Been around for years and still great quality! I've had oxtail, brown stew chicken, curry chicken. You name it. Plate is always full and taste is great! Shows promise.  Place is very nice.  Beer is good, both Mindful brews and extensive beer list.  However, they clearly were not ready to open.  Menu is fairly extensive, but they were out of avocados, so no guacamole appetizer, out of some necessary ingredient for one of the signature drinks, out of chicken (?), and had to substitute boneless chicken breast for boneiin fried chicken.  Also, heard another customer ordering pierogies, only to be told they were out of those too.  We certainly will give this place another try, but they have lots of work to do. Very excited to check the place out- wine, beer and cocktails on tap in the South Hills!  Not to mention a huge bottled beer selection! Very cool atmosphere. They seated us right when we came, we had called ahead with a 45 minute wait and they texted us when the table was ready. When the waitress came she swiftly informed us that the guacamole was sold out. I order a fish sandwich and turned out that was additionally sold out minutes before. Instead I ordered the salmon BLT on a \"brioche bun\" and \"hand cut fries\". Needless to say, they sold out of their golden brown brioche buns and provided a sub par generic bun and frozen french fries (which took over 30 minutes to come out!). My boyfriend ordered wings which were the typical fried jumbo wings (with the extra end) and the garlic oil which just tasted like clarified butter. The beer was good, nothing exceptional. The manager came over and apologized offering to sub a salad and ended up comping our check for the poor meal. While the management and the serving staff were VERY accommodating and understanding, I am not sure if I would come back here for another meal until the kinks are worked out--a beer, definitely. We waited 2 hours for a table.  Not a big deal. It's a new place and we were able to go to the bar.  \n\nHowever, When we finally were served after getting a table, they were out of pizzas.  Fine, I get it, you're busy and new.  We ordered burgers.  All four of us have been sitting here over an hour and still have not received our food.  Our server, while very polite, said \"I'm sorry, this is typical, if I could speed up the process I would, but it takes well over an hour to get food here.\"\n\nThey clearly have a lot to figure out.  Not ready for a busy Thursday night.  Can't imagine what it's like on a weekend, but I won't be here. First time here and I adore this place. Great selection of beer and the food is excellent. Service is really good. This is their official opening day. We got here around 5:30 to try to beat the rush. They were offering happy hour on their mindful brewing beers ($4 beer, $6 apps). I'm very impressed with the design and layout. I thought it would be packed - but we got a table upstairs right away. We tried the pizza and pierogies and both were delicious. We got our food within 15 minutes and our drinks in less than 5. Good music and just an overall good vibe. \n\nI really like this place and bonus - it's only 8 minutes from my house. Would recommend this place to anyone who is a brewery fan. I'm absolutely coming back! Stopped in for a flight of beers and a salad for lunch.  Ate at the bar.  Service was very good, enjoyed all three beers (Porter, Hefeweizen & Kolsch) and the Beet Salad was served quickly, and was very good.  The restaurant was very nice, clean, and had a nice, modern ambience.  They have numerous beers on draught, not just ones brewed here, but other local, and regional breweries too, also including cider, and surprisingly, even a few cocktails and wines on tap as well.  Looking forward to coming back and trying some of the other menu items and beer styles. We decided to go to the grand opening of Mindful today. We went at lunch hoping it wouldn't be as crowded as it would be in the evening. We chose to sit in the restaurant and we were seated immediately. The restaurant was only half full. There are a lot of options on the menu-starters, pizza, and wings to name a few categories. We started with an order of bone in wings. You can also get boneless if you prefer. It took about 30 minutes to get them. They were crispy, which I love, with the sauce served on the side. We ordered Garlic Parmesan but it tasted like clarified butter with no hints of garlic or parm. \nIt took another 30-45 minutes to get our food. I ordered the Plain Jane burger with Gorgonzola cheese, lettuce, pickles, and bacon. The top of the bun looked burnt. The top of my burger also looked burnt. The inside of the burger was almost red. It was very dry. The bacon could have been cooked a little bit longer. I ate 1/4 of it and left the rest. The French fries were bordering on cold so I didn't even try one. \nThe fish sandwich was good. It was a nice size piece of fish. The tarter sauce was homemade and it was very tasty. Some might prefer a little pickle in it but I liked it the way it was. The fish came with tortilla chips. Their version of tortilla chips is large triangles of fried dough. They are house made. I didn't care for them at all. \nWe heard from people around us that they waited an hour for their food. One guy waited over 40 minutes for a Chicken salad. Some might think they would keep the beer flowing to take your mind off of the long wait for food but it was difficult to find your waiter and then it took over 15 minutes to get a beer. We were there for 3 hours and was only offered water refills once. And it's probably a good thing to not drink a lot because on the first floor the men's and the women's bathrooms have only one toilet. At one point there was a line for the women's room. \nWe had two friends come in to check it out and we invited them to sit with us.  They ordered a Hummus plate and a chicken sandwich. After 45 minutes of waiting they cancelled their food order. \nOn the ground floor is the restaurant on one side and the bar on the other. On the top floor their is another bar with less selection and is a seat yourself area. I'm not sure if you could order food from that area or not. They also have a small outside patio on the top floor. \nI know that it was their grand opening and grace should be given but we knew that they had done 5 private openings before opening to the public. That is more than enough times of practicing to get things right for a Grand opening. The two stars is for their beer selection.  It was the only highlight of the trip. Pretty close to perfect. Upscale, sleek, very cosmopolitan (reminds me of Toronto). Great menu, and could easily bury the competition with an extensive selection of beer. Too bad I hate beer, because they seem to have everything, with good bartenders to boot. Can't find fault with anyone that can do REALLY good wings...and boy, they are: meaty, juicy, really great flavors.  Just try to keep me from coming back, even though a bit pricey. This place has potential, but I was extremely disappointed for my first trip. The beer list is extensive, but they were out of 3 different beers I asked for. I ordered the boneless wings to eat. They were the same price as a burger, so I figured it would be a decent sized plate. Each \"wing\" was half the size of a chick fil a nugget, and the wing sauce only comes on the side. I had to order pierogies after that just to get a normal sized dinner. The only saving grace is that they have a bottle shop with over 1000 options, which is convenient for local residents since PA has archaic beer laws. I returned to DeBlasio's after an absence of more than three years and I am glad I did.  I wish the restaurant served pizza in the dining room during dinner, but unless it is slow, one must go to the bar for it.  That turned out to be fine and it enabled me and my significant other to avail ourselves of delicious food at bargain happy hour prices: $2.50 for draft beers, $5.00 for a delicious and ample order of fried zucchini, and one of the best pizzas in the area, $13.99 for a twelve-cut large and just $1.00 for each excellent topping.  The restaurant was very generous with the toppings.  The high-priced item that we enjoyed was a Pittsburgh tradition, the pecan ball.  It was $6.99, but it was scrumptious and enormous, plenty for two.  We shall return!  Bravo! My sister and I drink nothing but Dairy Pure 1%. Twice, after very recently discovering this location, it wasn't on the shelf. (No biggie!) I asked different associates on both occasions for help. All of them were prompt and friendly, and successful in finding the right one. On a real note, these real people deserve appreciation. Thanks everyone! Ordered take out tonight.  They won't give a total over the phone.  Doesn't make sense for a place that only accepts cash.  Got home to find that the cheese that comes that comes standard with my sandwich was missing but the onions I asked to be left off weren't.  My husband's order wasn't right either.  The bread was the only thing that was good.  Guess that's what you get from a place with four young teenagers behind the counter all eating. I've been to this location many times. I really enjoy their customizable burgers. They have a variety of meat choices and vegan options, toppings, a bread choices. The burgers come with homemade chips but I opt for the sweet potato fries. Although known for their burgers, they also have nachos, salads, soups, and more. \n\nBurgatory is also know for their shakes. You can get shakes even made with alcohol. The non-alcoholic shakes are only $6 and they have a bunch of different flavors with a rotating weekly shake flavor. \n\nOn this visit, Burgatory was having an Apple Pie shake. I was leaving the area and once I found out, I turned back around just to go get it. I ordered my shake and asked for the leftover shake they usually give you when dining in. I've asked for this several times before. However, thus time I was told that the to-go cup is larger than the dine-in cup. I said, ok and didn't press the issue. However the bartender didn't seem that interested in providing service. I was sitting there ready to pay but she kept her back to me and cleaned cups until my shake came. She also never asked my mother if she wanted to order anything. This isn't my normal experience there but I was disappointed. \n\nI still enjoy Burgatory and would come back, but this definitely put a damper on my experience with the restaurant. Silk Road is fresher than any other Chinese restaurant I've ever been too. As a vegetarian, fresh vegetables are a must. My veggies are always brightly colored and still crisp. Make sure to specify that you are vegetarian.... I've ordered vegetable Pad Thai a few times and was disappointed that it had chicken in it. Their sushi is just as fresh. I try to be careful with what I eat and can even have the hibachi without feeling guilty. They are always happy to prepare the food to meet my needs. It's also really nice to support a family owned restaurant with a very hands on family. Delicious Chinese food!!!   The Kung pao chicken is really good.  They also have the best hibachi in Pittsburgh in my opinion.  Definitely worth a visit Everything here is wonderful... my husband and I have eaten our way through the menu.... tried multiple arancini, salads, rolls (pepperoni - yum!), and we tried the Sicilian pizza tonight.  Hands down best Sicilian pizza I've had in Pittsburgh.  The arancini is delicious - we never go without ordering an Al Burro. The service is great and everyone who works there is so friendly! Also - Thursday and Friday are open late... we love to take a bottle of wine (BYOB!) on Friday and have a great meal. It was our first time there. The woman behind the counter was very friendly. She explained all the choices. We had the arancini. It was very good. It is meat, peas and sauce wrapped in rice breaded and fried. We will go back again some day. I went there for a business lunch. I had the Chicken Parmesan sandwich and it was outstanding. The chicken was perfect and the sauce was awesome as well. There were 5 of us all together and everyone enjoyed their meals. The only reason it's not 5 out of 5 as it was very loud in there, it could have just been the other guests but I found it annoying. I would gladly go back for lunch. Very pleasant atmosphere. Great food, service, and variety of spirits to please anyone. New Years buffet was very good. Definitely a place to bring relatives. Went for dinner on a Tuesday when house wines are 1/2 off. I ordered a special : salmon prepared on a cedar plank. Our excellent waiter Peter explained it was an entree on New Year's Eve and so popular they brought it back. It was the most delicious salmon I have ever eaten was dining last night with my daughter and others. Couldn't have been treated any better. Food very tasty and was presented beautifully. Would go back for dinner . Lunch is also very good.Had to compliment the chef for not only good food, but presentation. kudos.                                    \n\n-Maryann Lyle We were greeted by a wonderful hostess. We had reservations and we were immediately seated. The dining room was huge. I believe there are a few different rooms and a big bar area. We were seated and I immediately noticed how chilly it was. We were waited on quickly by our waitress. She was nice. Although when I checked in on my Yelp app, I unlocked  dollar off a beverage coupon. She went and got the manager who seemed very confused saying she had never seen this before. But it is your offer? Anywho, we ordered drinks. The martinis were very good but very small. And they do have a huge selection of beer. So, we ordered a pretzel to start. It was huge and good. Nice app to share at the table. I ordered the Parma  chicken aka chicken parmesan minus the mushrooms. It was good. The gnocchi was really good! The chicken was a little overdone but not bad. The hubby ordered the gnocchi and sausage and enjoyed it immensely. Our friend ordered the butternut squash ravioli and enjoyed it saying it was very good. Our other friend offered the lasagna. First it didn't come out with the other three dinners and when it did and he got into the middle it was stone cold. He sent it back, not 5 minutes later it was back. The outside was hot the inside was still stone cold. Two different managers came to apologize. They asked if he would like a different meal and he went with the gnocchi and sausage. They offered him a free beer and he declined. They offered him a free dessert which he also declined. The portions here a huge. When they got the bill the only thing that wasn't on there was the lasagna, well it was on there and taken off. They even charged him for the beer he did have?! What? He couldn't even eat with us. They brought the beer up to our waitress and she reluctantly took it off their bill saying she had not been aware he was offered a free beer. Ummm then why were we visited by two different managers. And if you offer a free dessert and he chose not to take that, take the cost off a dessert off the bill. It was not the greatest customer service experience I have ever seen to say the least. And just a side note, the portions are big but you pay for them. Our bill which included two martinis, a beer (glass sizes  are small here), an app, and two dinners came to $86 not including tip. This was the first time we order pizza at this store. The service was very good the guy who delivered the pizza was very polite and friendly. The pizza was delicious. We will definitely make this our new delivery pizza store $20 for a half a cheesesteak sandwich and salad. Ordered mushrooms and onions both were raw???  I threw it out as it tasted like body odor if that's possible. Probably the most expensive and worst tasting cheese steak I've ever had. I called and they offered to replace it. I wouldn't take the chance as I'm concerned I'll have food poisoning. Carbonara's, to me, is your run of the mill Italian American restaurant. The sauce was sweet and the veal Parmesan was enjoyable. Would I come here again? Probably. Did it stand out? Not really. \n\nAs with most Italian American restaurants, the portions were huge. So huge, that the hubby and I split an order of veal parm and it was enough to fill us. Our entree came with a side of pasta and a salad, which weren't too memorable, but were satisfying nonetheless. \n\nGiven the distance from me, I will probably order from here again. However, I don't think I'll ever really have a craving for Carbonara's. This is, sadly, my first negative Yelp review and I have an extensive history as a lead bartender, lead server / trainer, cook and restaurant manager.  I went for dinner this evening and the entire visit was disappointing.  After ordering our meals at the table, I stopped by the bar to get a drink and check the televisions.  I ordered a Sambuca and the bartender did not immediately know what it was.  She asked the other bartender who advised her to ask me if I wanted white or black.  I responded white, but was poured black.  It was slightly loud, but I believe she repeated white as the woman to my left even heard me say it.  Paid for it and insisted on drinking the black as it was busy and she may not have heard me.  Not enough to even be upset about.  Next, I had ordered wedding soup as I have several times before.  This time, it was almost all spinach and very bland.  Still, not too bothered.  My chicken marsala had arrived and the chicken was chewy and severely overcooked.  Still was not going to say  anything.  Then, the proverbial straw.  I had noticed Sam Adams Winter on tap while I was in the bar and ordered one as our meals arrived.  Several minutes later, our server returned with an amber coloured beer.  Before she even placed it on the table, I told her that this was not the beer I ordered.  She left the table and within moments returned with the same glass of beer and said she was told, presumably by one of the bartenders, that this was Sam Winter.  I told her Sam Winter was dark and this was definitely some form of wheat or white beer, probably the Sam Spring.  She scoffed as she asked me if I wanted it or not.  I said no and she walked away with no apology and even showed signs of being upset.  As we were almost finishing our meals, she returned and told me that it was, in fact, the Sam Adams Cold Snap I had said it was earlier.  This entire back and forth led me to write this review.  It seems that the food quality has fallen as has the service and especially the bar staff.  As a highly experienced bartender, I can understand not being able to tell the visual difference between different light beers, but to not be able to notice that a white or wheat beer is being poured instead of a darker bock or lager is beyond unacceptable.  Even much more unacceptable is to return to the table with the same beer I returned once and telling me it is what I ordered.  I highly doubt I will ever give this restaurant another chance. This is probably my favorite chipotle in the Pittsburgh area. I never feel like I'm being jipped. It seems like portion sizes are ever the same at chipotle. The scoops here always appear reasonable. It does get busy during lunch time and they could stand to focus on cleaning the eating area a little more when they're busier. I love this place the staff are always so welcoming and friendly you get a lot of food for your money Rushed us out while we were eating!! Handed us our check while we were eating, and brought us to-go containers. My husband paid with his card and they took it immediately. I was tipping in cash as usual.... but didn't get a chance to put it in since I was STILL EATING!!! And they came over asking \" Why you no tip? You need to tip to pay for show!\" How rude!!! I was still eating!!! I told the manager who acted dumb just asking us who our waitress was over and over... we won't be back! This place is where I and my son tried our first Chipotle food. I know it is weird but we are new in States. We really enjoyed the food, it was delicious and satisfying. The staff was really helpful and friendly. The guy behind us in the line told us that we would be hooked and become an addict. I think he is right. It seems like We will certainly go there a lot. Parking is easy, the place is clean, the food is good, and people are nice. Couldn't ask for more! Il Pizzaiolo is dishing out some serious Italian food. Quite unexpectedly they also make the best Neapolitan pizza I've had, though to be fair I've never been to Naples. A deliciously thin and chewy crust, but not crispy, Neapolitan crusts should never be crispy. The pizza may be the star of the show, but the rest of the offerings are also delicious. The fresh burrata appetizer is wonderfully creamy. The arancini are good, but would maybe benefit from a bold and spicy saucy. Don't sleep on a classic, the chicken Marsala was seriously excellent. I hear most of the pasta is housemade and since I didn't have any, I have a reason to stop back the next time I'm in PGH. WORSE PIZZA & very expensive!  Frozen pizza much better, plus what a bunch of stuck up bourgeois employee attitudes! Best homemade chicken tenders ever! The folks here are always super friendly and you can't beat all the candy everywhere! I also love that there are toys for the kids to play with in the back room. Oh, and did I mention that the bathroom has 15 soaps to choose from!? Seriously, if you don't come back to the table don't know why. You're still figuring out which one to use. This is always a hit whether or not there are two of us or 20 of us. Only reason it's not getting a five star? Just may be a bit spendy for barfood. That said, it's great food! So maybe I shouldn't be complaining. I always root for Cocina Mendoza because of two reasons:  first they are family owned and second, because they are simply such genuine, friendly, welcoming people.   Those opinions aside, here is a candid review of the restaurant.\n\nCocina Mendoza is classified, in my mind, as a middling authentic restaurant which takes liberties with the mid-Atlantic, or Pittsburgh, palate. Upon entering into the restaurant which has a fairly large sign outside its strip-mall location (free open lot parking) and legit clever decor inside (with music playing and big t.v.'s) you will seat yourself more often than not.  This is traditional.  \n\nYou will be greeted by one of several very sweet, friendly, bi-lingual Spanish and English speaking employees who will bring you a basket of corn tortilla chips and red salsa.  The chips are from a bag.  I've had three of their salsas, the standard, the tomatillo, and the chile de arbol.  The standard, house salsa they bring free to your table may or may not be made in house but it is not made with fresh tomatoes or other fresh ingredients.  It is also somewhat sweeter than I prefer though that may be a product of covering up the use of canned tomatoes or perhaps their regional Acapulco recipe is just sweet.  I am not nearly as familiar with Acapulco as I am with many other regions of Mexico. The tomatillo sauce was warmed and has a consistency that reminded me of bottled salsas using corn syrup.  I did not like it either.  The chile de arbol was EXCELLENT the four or five times I've had it.  It tastes delicious, authentic, and spicy in every way. \n\nAfter trying the salsas, I could tell they are cutting corners in certain ways to make fiscal ends meet.  I totally understand these decisions however if I could make a recommendation to them:  start making 100% fresh, spicy authentic salsas and tortilla chips your family would eat. In this area, salsas set the table for what is to come.  I am confident Cocina Mendoza KNOWS this. As a customer, it is tough to change an opinion after a rough opening act. They will definitely bring in more customers if they properly set the table with an excellent salsa.  After all, they could always hide pre-made ingredients and cut corners with other less obvious dishes and unsuspecting palates.\n\nDespite two of the three failed salsas, I've had between 12 and 15 meals in the restaurant or used their take-out option.  I can easily attest to the fact that their CARNITAS tacos with fresh cut WHITE onion, FRESH cilantro, FRESH cut radish, and fresh lime wedges are truly mouthwatering, moist and delicious.  I believe they'd be proud to serve these tacos, which are on a double soft corn shell, to anyone in the Hispanic community.  Again, I rave about them because they are very, very, very good.  I've had other dishes from bistec to pollo to fajita dishes which were  authentic and very well done!  I've also had popular dishes that were pre-made and Americanized (even if they shouldn't be) ... they weren't good and could potentially drive customers away with bad word of mouth experiences. I don't order food I know to be Americanized Mexican.  If I wanted that kind of food I'd just go to Mad Mex or another box restaurant.\n\nCocina Mendoza makes good food when staying true to their roots. However, they \"Americanize\"  certain things, put items like extra big ground beef burritos on the menu, cut corners with obviously pre-made sauces (like enchilada ranchero sauce) or smother dishes with cheese masking depth of flavor leading many to question their overall authenticity and consistency. \n\nIn a smart, necessary business decision, Cocina Mendoza caters to all clientele. So, if you are going to go to Cocina Mendoza to order a true Mexican staple and you will almost certainly like your very good food.  If you order something that is not a traditional staple or you order an authentic something which has a suspect description, or order Tex-Mex you should expect the food to be average at best, watered down, prepared for a dull palate. \n\nOverall, in my opinion, Cocina Mendoza needs to stop trying to straddle the middle ground by being authentic with some things and cutting Americanized corners with others. Or, perhaps, they need to use fresher ingredients and make better Americanized food to cater to the masses.  Hence, the mixed reviews are accurate depending on the customer's palate, the cook of the day, the quality of  ingredients, and which dish was ordered.\n\nComparison:  Cozumel.  My take:  Your mileage may vary so I have no recommendation. This restaurant does a very good job. The portions are generous so much so that I had to take some of mine home. I had a taco, tostada, enchilada and fajita. The fajita was the only thing I didn't like. The other three were very good and tasty. The server was very friendly and the place is very clean. I'll go again. This is the best restaurant in Regent Square. \n\nI've had several dishes, all of which are excellent. In my opinion, this is also the best Thai in Pittsburgh.\n\nShrimp Pad Thai is fantastic. Good portion eat in or take-out, with tons of big, juicy shrimp. The Cottage Wings are quite honestly the best wings I've had in Pittsburgh. I could probably eat 20+ of these things at a time. Everything I've eaten has been perfect.\n\nThe staff is also very welcoming. The taller lady (I think she may be the owner or manager) always greets us with a friendly smile, kind words, and excellent service. She seems to really be doing what she loves (and she's doing a great job). We have never waited for a table here, even with the place being as tiny as it is.\n\nMy girlfriend and I live close enough to walk to this place, and we do so on a fairly regular basis. It's our go-to if we want to stay local.\n\nThe only (small) complaints are as follows: They serve soda in cans, but this is sort of the modus operandi for a lot of Thai restaurants, so I can't really come down too hard on them for this one. The other issue is how close the seating can be, but this sort of thing comes with the territory in the city. Ordered takeout for pickup at 4pm on a weekday. The woman who took my order made sure I understood I would be charged dinner prices, and I said this was fine. I ordered the chicken satay, green curry, and pad see eew, which came to thirty-some dollars. \n\nWas disappointed upon getting home and unwrapping the seriously small portions. I couldn't believe that even the white rice container was only 3/4 full. They are seriously skimping on white rice? I'd put the portion size at maybe 60% of other Thai restaurants nearby (e.g. Bangkok Balcony or Curry on Murray), but at nearly the same prices. \n\nThe saving grace was that the food was delicious. Perhaps portion sizes are better in-house? Let's start with the good.  The restaurant had a nice atmosphere and the staff is friendly.  Although I was not able to partake, there looked to be over 20 different beers on tap. \n\nEvery Mexican restaurant I have ever been to will provide you with complementary chips and salsa once you are seated, but not this place, which was a little disappointing.  The rice had the color of Spanish or Mexican rice, but had the flavor of plain unseasoned white rice.  The shrimp and chicken fajitas were very flavorful and I really enjoyed them.  \n\nNot a bad place to eat, j just missed the complementary chips and salsa and I wish the rice had flavor. This place is pretty great.  50 beers on draft.  Nice Happy Hour specials on drinks and food.  Stayed for the band that came on at 9.  Nice little stage and dance area.  Overall, high grades for my first visit since the renovation. My daughter and I stopped in this weekend to try out First Watch and found the beautiful place to be friendly and a very interesting menu. I had to try the fresh juices and just loved them! I also experimented with the smoked salmon frittata and was amazed at how good this was. I am looking forward to returning. This place was excellent! Kind of out of the way from the city but definitely a must if you live in or are visiting Pittsburgh! Lots of healthy options but full of flavor! I got the carrot cake pancakes and the power bowl. Both were excellent! If I come back here I'll definitely make another stop in! My husband and I stopped here for lunch one Sat around the holidays. It was so busy. We were slightly irritated at first because it took around 20 mins before someone came to take our drink order. The table next to us was sat mins before us and we're waiting as well.  3 waitress were in our area and none of them made eye contact with us or got our drink order. Finally someone came and got the drink order at the table next to us and then immediately left to get thier drinks (instead of saving a trip and taking our order as well) when we finally got service it was good. The food was delicious. We got the lunch 1/2 deal. I got half a sandwich and 1/2 a salad. Lots of flavor and a nice presentation. I think the place needs to be open for a while to get the service down. It's a cute rustic farmhouse restaurant. We plan on going back once the new crowd dies down. We definitely want to try out the breakfast menu. It looks amazing. J and I came here for breakfast yesterday. A few things to note: when you are en route to this place, use the No Wait app to get in line, as this place typically gets packed; parking absolutely sucks so get there early if you want a spot in the lot, or be prepared to park farther away and walk as we had to. Now, this place was great. The decor was rustic and fun with bright windows and a nice warm feel to it. Everyone there was so nice and friendly, which was great. J ordered coffee and I had tea. Our waitress left the coffee and hot water carafes on our table, which was so nice and a check mark in our book. They're menu had a lot of really nice, fresh items and interesting combinations which was great. J ordered the traditional breakfast with scrambled eggs, ham, potatoes and toast with homemade strawberry jam. I ordered the smoked salmon and veggie frittata and added mushrooms and broccoli. My frittata came with ciabatta toast and a salad of greens. Everything was delicious and prepared really well. We would definitely recommend this place for breakfast as our experience overall was great. Happy to report that food & service continues to be top notch. They have expanded their footprint (good sign already hu'h?) and the restaurant is more 'roomy' now. More servers and attention to customer service (prompt refills).\n\nSpecial Chicken Biryani still rocks. So does Cut Mirchi. And pastries. Butter Scotch pastry is still amazing.\n\nAnd, Mr.Senthil. Da man! Great place to watch a game or catch a good band. It's been my go to since I moved to the north hills. Order some food and you won't be disappointed! This place is really close to the office so I'll probably come here more than I would otherwise.\n\nI ordered takeout via online ordering.\n\nSteamed Pork Dumplings:  Excellent.  They are fairly large and the filling is flavorful, the dumpling itself is very soft, and they're served piping hot with a soy based sauce.\n\nHot and Sour Soup:  More sour than anything else.  The texture is kind of gelatinous; not generally what I expect from a good soup.  The bamboo shoots, mushrooms, and tofu in it are standard fare.\n\nMassaman Curry: The menu describes this dish as a sweet curry and I ordered it to be moderately spicy.  It is definitely sweet and there was no spice on my lips or in my throat.  The potatoes are undercooked and crunchy. There is also no depth of flavor that you usually get with a nice curry.  It is also the most greasy curry I've had; the grease was not contained and got all over the takeout bag and shortly thereafter my hands.  It is just okay.\n\nService was good - my food was ready at the estimated time and was still hot when I got back to my office to eat it.  Another positive is the price - the lunch portion of curry was $7.95. We came in on a Monday night, it was not so busy and we were seated right away.\n\nOur waitress was very nice and attentive.\n\nThe restaurant is classy and comfortable.\n\nI had the Tom Khah soup with shrimp it was delicious, I loved the taste of the coconut milk it was a perfect balance with the spicy red pepper.\nThen I had the Volcano Roll yum! Great place, I'd come back again Came here on a whim and I was pleasantly surprised.  With all of the other restaurants around, I'll be honest, I didn't know what this place was because I had never been.  The staff is exceedingly nice and helpful, I definitely would recommend asking them if you have any questions.\n\nMy husband had the mango curry with chicken and I had the duck pad thai soup because I wanted something light and different.  I'm not a thai expert by any means, but if I knew the soup portion was going to be so big I probably would have split it with the hubby. It's BIG and filling, but pretty delicious. The duck was pretty good too.\n\nTo drink I ordered the jasmine tea, which was really refreshing, but probably not the best to drink with soup. It was like transferring from hot food to hot drink.  My husband's mango curry was good. With the curry you determine how spicy you want it, and he ordered a 6. We like spicy food, but what I learned from thai food is that it's a different type of spice than your normal cajun style or mexican food. For some reason the mango seemed to retain most of the spice, which had our nose running a bit more than eating spicy crawfish. So just be careful on how spicy you order your meals! \n\nI took the rest of my soup (of course I didn't finish) to go, but their plastic bowl was flimsy. Thank goodness I asked for a plastic bag to hold the to go bowl. I probably live 5 minutes away from the place and by the time I got out of my car the soup leaked so much I had to throw the remains away.  \n\nIn all, would I come to the place again? Yes, but I think next time I'll try it for lunch during a weekday.  They have lunch specials on the back of their menu, and it's probably better portion controlled than their dinner options. Usually, not terrible. I would not recommend going on a night that the parking lot looks empty. Burnt tasting soup. Burnt, sitting for a while coffee, dry pork all are what come with a visit when they are not busy. From having a meeting and hearing all of the staff stand around the bar and talk, to hearing loud singing from the kitchen. This was far from worth it for a $122 bill for two people meeting. A shame and unprofessional. On an up note, the devil eggs are awesome. Try to imagine a meal where the server literally does not give a single f --- Tonight, we were waited on by Zach Galifianakis' doppelg\u00e4nger. It was not good. I will give points for a tasty appetizer of smoked salmon with quail egg and the chicken and mushroom pasta entree was okay. The lobster bisque was actually gross. But not as gross as the service. Never going back. Oh, and the $12 wine pour was less than two fingers, which I believe is only okay if we are talking about tequila. This place has incredible wings.  I have had every flavor and they are all great, although the regular Buffalo are my favorite.  They also have great homemade ranch.  The place is a little rundown inside, but the great food and drinks more than makes up for it. Not what Mitchell's used to be. There was a hair in my food and the bathrooms were less than clean. For a $70 bill for each of us (once my Salmon was taken off), far from worth it.\n\nI would love for them to be what they used to be. Good happy hour prices! Otherwise overrated! Don't order the chargrilled oysters. They're not even in a half shell and served with burnt cheese and butter on the side. Make sure to ask for in a shell which they don't tell you about. Crispy shrimp was good. I suggest that! This place is usually busy but well staffed. We come here often but usually only around all you can eat shrimp. We love trying the differemt and new shrimp flavors. The re-orders arrive quickly and you can immediately place another order. Also.. cheddar bay biscuits, what else is there to say? We have been hearing about this place for z few months now and decided to show up Friday night. I checked the YELP reviews in advance to plan out our selections.   The sliced pizza rolls and the full sized wings were excellent and the friendly staff really put you at ease.  This sounds like almost all of the other ratings but it's all true. This is such a cute little ice cream shop! I love that it is all homemade and is a family owned business. Everyone is always so friendly! I also love that they have the little baking shop attached. It's a great place to get all the unique supplies. My husband and I order from green garden atleast twice a month and LOVE it. It's so easy to order online and delivery is freaky fast! The staff is always so friendly and the food is great.  You get a lot of food for your money as well. I would definitely recommend Green Garden! We had full intentions on heading out for Thai after the mall. On the way we drove by mad mex and changed our minds. We had never been to this location so I went with it. \n\nThere was a small wait (10-15min). We headed to the car to waited for their text (**holy guacamole your table is ready) lol.\n\nThis location seemed just as hip as all other mad mexs. They also played a cool mix of music (ay where the party at. Hahaha). I went with the wing wrap and chose San Franscico sauce and a side of waffle fries. I also ordered a side salad because I was a little hungry and figured the food wait may be long due to crowd. (the wait wasn't long by the way). The salad was filling and very fresh. The wing wrap was great. We always order the same thing lol. My bf ordered a chimichanga as always. We passed on margaritas although the big asz one is $7 10-12pm. \n\nOverall everything was good. We normally head to the Oakland one which is crowded especially during the special. This location was def a step above Oakland. Woo hoo. My boyfriend and I visit this location frequently, mainly because we live in the North Hills and it is close. If it is a Friday night after a long week, we enjoy coming to this location due to proximity and the intimate setting. Tonight will be the last visit we make to the North Hills Mad Mex. Upon arrival, I knew there would be a wait so we were seated within about 25 minutes, as quoted: a good start! Upon seating, we ordered our drinks, and ordered our meals at the same time. Lucky for the server, after I ordered, my boyfriend asked to have the exact same thing. After sipping our libations for maybe 10 minutes or so, my order came out and was sat in front of me. After sitting, awaiting Joe's order, for another 5 minutes or so, I hailed our server and asked where the other order was. She went to check, and came back to report she hadn't recorded both orders as \"2\" of the same in the POS system. Okay, no biggie right! She went to put in the order for him and we waited maybe another 5-10 minutes and the table behind us (Seated after us) was delivered an identical order to his. At this point, I'm still sitting with my plate in front of me, like a gentleman, awaiting his entree. I couldn't bear to even mention to him that I pondered that could actually be HIS meal that was given to the other table. The server stopped back and told us she kept stopping at the kitchen to babysit the on-the-fly order that she put in for Joe. At this point i'm starving so I start to eat, my food is now lukewarm. Another 5 minutes or so and his meal came out; she offered half-off the meal. Half off? For our wait, my lukewarm wing wrap, and  his uber-delayed dinner? Okay, minor insult. Either comp the meal or don't mention it at all. I immediately asked for it to-go and she brought boxes and a bag; he boxed the meal himself. So you brought it and won't even put it in the to-go containers? I can't even. We will not be back. There are a handful of Mad Mex in Pittsburgh that I love to frequent, however this will have to be off-the-list for a long time. Being forced to pay any amount for a meal that was not enjoyed by a couple together, as was intended, after a long week at work is just abhorrent. We might as well have gone to Burgatory and got in-line on the No Wait app before we left our house; that may have solved the entire debacle. What a shame. Every time I order something that you need sauce for it they forget it.   So the last time I ordered cheesy bread I called after ordering from the dominos app to make sure they wouldn't forget the sauce.   Good news, they didn't forget.  Bad news they gave me the wrong salad.   I decided to order the same order tonight.  This time I didn't call.   Good news,  they got the salad right this time.   Bad news, they forgot the sauce.  I've had enough of the bad service so this time I called to complain.   I was offered double sauces on my next order.   I wasn't going to eat the food without sauce and I wanted them to bring the sauce.  I was told it would take 45 minutes.   The location is 5 minutes away tops.  So at 45 mins I asked for a new order of cheesy bread.  It came fairly quickly but the damage was done.  I've been ordering from this location for years and service has just gone down hill.   I like Domino's but damn, can't corporate do something about this location? Stopped in for an early dinner with my girlfriend after shopping in Pittsburgh. Atmosphere was nice. Anywhere you sat, you were able to catch the game on one of the many TVs. We had the chili nachos for an app(which I highly recommend). The only reason I am leaving 4 stars is because the two of us had burgers cooked medium. Her's was an actual medium and mine was well done. Other than that everything was great. I would return a second time if I were in the area. Since first opening, Wheelfish has improved its menu. It now offers meals that include sides instead of serving everything a la carte. I really like this update to the menu! They also have expanded their menu to include more offerings and I can't wait to work my way through them! Two stars might be generous. We came to DeLucas to get some of the lobster bisque that I love. Alas- this is only a weekend option. Fine.\nMy husband ordered a coffee, a sandwich, and a side of breakfast ham. He had to ask for the coffee 3x before it finally got there and the ham twice. \nI ordered the fish sandwich with onion rings. Sandwich comes and it's dry and over cooked with four pieces of cold cheese plopped on top. The onion rings came about 5 minutes later and they were squishy and under cooked.\nSUPER disappointing, and the worst part is the server has this cocky, careless attitude the whole time. If you get this server, you will know what I'm talking about. I found myself becoming envious of another table that had a friendly and animated waitress.\nWe were never asked how the food was by our server, the manager who was milling about, or the lady who took our payment. I decided that if I WAS asked, I would have been honest and posted a favorable review if it was addressed. It was not.\nYou got it wrong, DeLucas. And while people wait for a LONG time for a table here- it wasn't even busy today. And they also seem to forget they have an open kitchen. So when we ask about the missing items and you say \"they're on their way\" but turn around and ask the staff to make them quickly, we hear you.\nTwo stars because I'll probably be back for the bisque- but for takeout ONLY! Eaten there several times. Always excellent service and food. Clean bathrooms.  Priced right, more food than I can eat. The food is good just wasn't happy that it took over an hour for us to not even get our delivery. Had the Peanut Butter burger - was so good.  Went back again the next day and ate it again. I love Burgartory! I try to fix my burger a little different every time and it always comes out delicious. I just wonder if some of the customization get a little lost in the process. Like I feel like I can't really taste the difference between angel dust, diablo dust and Kingston jerk. No difference though. As long as my burger is tasty and cooked right I won't fuss. The $1.50 upcharge on the fries is not worth it. They were hard and crispy and for all that I could have just stuck with chips for free. \n\nI also had the chocolate milkshake. I know..how gluttonous of me. It was amazing. Everything is clearly fresh and made with quality ingredients. I think next time I will get my milkshake spiked...because they do that. \n\nService was great once we got to the table but they quoted us at 10-15 minutes to be seated and we didn't get to a table for about 30 minutes. A little annoyed with that only because the hostess should just properly quote the wait and then we would have just gone to eat at the bar. \n\nOverall, delicious...great service and great ambiance. I'll be back again for sure. I always love it when I have time for a bagel in the Pittsburgh airport. Bruegger's are some of the best! I have no idea why everybody does not give this diner five stars. Excellent home cooking and generous portions with very reasonable price. Highly recommend it! Second time I've been here. Just as good each time. Great service, great prices. Thanks Kelly Os staff! Visited Jan 1st at 12:30 pm and place was packed. Seat yourself and drink order was taken within 3 minutes, but then drinks were slow to arrive due to hand-off to another server. I got coffee and orange juice and ordered the small 1 egg meal with sausage, shredded potatoes with onion and pepper. I thought the menu said 75 cents for them, but it's 75 cents EACH. As others have reported, the shredded potatoes even with onions and peppers didn't have very much seasoning, so I'll be trying the home fries next time. Coffee was mediocre at best and orange juice was very fresh, of course, because it's squeezed on site in a large machine, but it was very light and not like what I'm accustomed to.\n\nHusband got the hot turkey sandwich with fries and they asked if he wanted gravy on both the sandwich and the fries and it was delicious like that. When the gravy on top cooled, the gravy underneath the sandwich was still piping hot. He gobbled the entire thing right down and said he'd definitely order that dish again.\n\nI got 1 single french toast and it was very good but I wouldn't go out of my way to order it again. We then shared the Zucchini fries with ranch on the side (another 50 cents extra) and they were also delicious!! We definitely recommend the hot turkey sandwich and the zucchini fries.\n\nWhile I'd say the food was mixed with some of the dishes were downright delicious and some were pretty mediocre, I think it's just a matter of finding the right dishes for you and your tastes. Once you've got it down, I think this place could definitely become a regular stop. \n\nService was slow and kind of sloppy throughout, but they had other duties like filling all sugar, salt, etc on tables so I give them a bit of a break. I would recommend Kelly O's if you're not worried about time.\n\nDecor/House: 3.5\nService: 2.5\nFood: 4.0 Super good coffee. Great Service!  Owner was very nice and individually made each coffee. Coffee and food are delicious but owner creeps me out. He is very controlling of the type of behavior his customers have and is very judgmental about what people order! For example, someone came in and ordered a coffee with espresso and the owner asked the customer \"are you sure you want that? It's got a lot of caffeine in it\" etc. he also doesn't know how to leave his customers alone when they are obviously trying to do work! The sandwiches are often raved about, and they're good, but I come here for the pizza - specifically the personal pizza.  It includes 3 toppings which makes it easy to order instead of fretting over how much extra an additional topping is.  The crust I think is what makes these pizzas standout.  It also pairs great with a beer and they have good craft beers on tap. At my most recent visit, there was 3 of us and we all wanted the pizza so we decided to get a 14\" deluxe which includes 5 toppings. It was large enough because we weren't starving, but on a more usual night we would need to order a larger pizza.  The crust in the center of the pizza was soggy.  This doesn't seem to be an issue with the smaller personal size pizzas. This is a good place if you're looking for a fun time with conversation that prompts laughter, to watch sports in the background, maybe to tell a few exaggerated stories. Primanti Bros. is never a bad choice. Great food and great place to watch sports. They always have good beer specials and recently added specials for after 9pm. The happy hour is always a plus, being half off all drinks. If you have never been to Primanti's before, you must try one of their famous sandwiches, piled high with whatever meat you want, French fries, cole slaw, and tomatoes. The Pittsburgher is their number two best seller, with their number one seller being Iron City beer. If you live in Pittsburgh and have never been to Primanti's before, you should go ASAP.  If you are a visitor, this should definitely be on your list to visit while you are in town! Delicious food option right by the Allegheny County Airport. I flew in with my wife and sister this past Sunday and we grabbed a quick lunch around 2pm. Although the restaurant looks dated from the outside, the interior is quite nice. There were a lot of locals seated at the bar. We weren't immediately welcomed by a hostess, but eventually found our way to take a seat with no issues.\n\nI ordered a french onion soup which was DELICIOUS. There was a fried onion ring inside it and the melted cheese was nice and gooey while the broth was hearty, sweet and salty. I had the special burger, while my wife had an open face steak sandwich with mushrooms and onions. My burger was A-OK, pretty decent, but nothing to write home about. The meat wasn't cooked evenly to order, but I get that it can be pretty hard to do that.\n\nService was fine throughout the experience and the coffee they had was tasty. Our meal came to be about $50 for 3-people for lunch. I ended up at Thee Olde Place by a total fluke. My husband and I were out and about after Christmas -- We had a great Groupon for a massage at Honor Your Body Wellness [best massage of my life! - https://www.yelp.com/biz/honor-your-body-wellness-pittsburgh?hrid=gRPKLeU9-W0rjVvKV4-AlA&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)] -- and, since we live so far away from the spa, we decided to make our local road trip to Baldwin a day date. We were looking for a unique place for lunch - and this is it! \n\nWe live near Bob's Garage, in Fox Chapel, which is known for it's outrageous Christmas decorations; however, we don't go very much anymore because it's a smoking establishment with below average food. Thee Olde Place Inn is now going to be my go-to place for the holidays. It was beautifully (and tastfully) decorated with garland, Nutcrackers, and wreaths. The fireplace kept the smaller dining area near the bar very cozy. And the food! I had one of the best piece of haddock I've had in a while, plus some very tasty from-scratch mac and cheese. My hubby had a fantastic burger and a few beers. \n\nOn a side note, two other cool things I noticed: There was another, huge dining room behind us, as well as a totally enclosed smoking area in the back, which we never smelled at all. Also, the ceiling tiles are covered with these really neat little twinkle lights that change pattern and color every few minutes.\n\nOur bill was reasonable; and, the waitress was super friendly and nice. Don't be discouraged by the underwhelming outside of the building - just walk on it and have an incredible meal. Overall, I'm so glad we found this place - and I hope to find a reason to make the trek back! We came at the end of a hard day, not dressed up but hungry, good servers and love the menues. Very easy to bring a larger group, still lots of intimate seating. Blah......The food is all butter and salt.   The pasta is poor quality and the sauce was basically tomato paste. I have yet to try anything here that wasn't excellent. Coffee, espresso, and tea have all been fantastic. Prices are very reasonable. Staff has been friendly and helpful every time I've visited. Nice decor, it's a pleasant, quiet spot without the obnoxious hipster atmosphere of my other neighborhood shop (that I no longer patronize). \n\nThe only negative is that they don't take cards, but something that insignificant is almost not worth mentioning. First, let me say, the pizza is some of the best I've ever had. Generous toppings, and a flavor that can only come from a well seasoned oven.\n\nThen why one star? The service. Waiting 45 minutes just for drinks? Over an hour for the bill? It's madness. I have been many times, the pizza is just that good. But, last time I neared my limit. Rude staff who you can hear talking crap about the customers from the back room. Never once getting a beverage refill in over an hour. What the heck! \n\nIt's a Pittsburgh legend for a reason. Good pizza. Nobody would dare say the same for the front of house staff. There is a competitor in turtle Creek that makes similar (but not quite as good) pizza. The service and management is light years better. Drive that extra mile, safe yourself a metric ton of frustration. I know my coffee and Coffee Tree Roasters gets a 2 snaps and hands held high. I can't believe it took me so long to sample and fall in love with their coffee. \n\nI love Starbucks for their tea but Coffee Tree has a wide variety of freshly roasted beans and I've never had a bad cup here. Quite frankly, each new flavor of the day I try tends to get better and better. Some of my faves have been the Papua New Guinea, Sumatra and Vienna Roast. These are the medium roast varieties which serve my purpose of waking up well. I love how you can take in these flavors and easily differentiate the the variance in balance and strength.  The coffee is never bitter and tastes fresh regardless of when I visit. I also love the fact that they have the little stickers that cover the coffee lid hole---so cute and fun. \n\nIt must be said that this place prides itself on freshly roasted beans.  If you want to brew your own at home, they have a huge menu for you to select from. There also are teas, coffees, chocolates and a gift section near the check out area.  It's a very cozy space and would be nice to catch up with a friend or two.  Keep in mind that the seating is limited here so you may need to wait for a table if you plan on enjoying their goodies in house. \n\nBe forewarned that their baked treats are to die for and they tempt you with samples on the counter. If you try a sample be prepared to have thoughts of sugarplums dancing in your head throughout the day along with wondering why you just didn't buy a whole piece of whatever you tasted.  \n\nThe service here is fast, efficient and friendly. Heck, I've been in a line back to the door with 1 worker at the counter who managed to serve everyone quickly. Since they've become Ting's Kitchen, they've become our new favorite spot to eat. My husband and I LOVE their Cumin Lamb. Perfectly seasoned and just SO good! Their menu has a huge array of dishes to select from.\n\nIf you're looking for an authentic dinner, I'd say stop here for sure. Their service is always great and the atmosphere inside is perfect for a casual night out to dinner or a date night dinner. We came here for a mini Christmas-get-together. I haven't been in here a while but this used to be one of my preferred restaurants when I lived in the area. Our server was very attentive and the beers on tap were awesome (not to mention the insane bottle selection that I did not delve into). There was a bit of a mix-up with food - my vegetarian hubby's sandwich came out with meat on it when he had requested no meat - but it was fixed with speed and grace from the staff. Be sure to stop in on your next visit to Robinson! I have been coming to Sushi Tomo for years and they are very consistent with high quality Japanese & Chinese dishes!\n\nI try to get at least one new item every time I come here, stretching my comfort zone far beyond when I first started dabbling with Chinese and Japanese. I can honestly say I have never got an item I did not throughly enjoy. Which is insane to me! \n\nI love that the green tea is served in a traditional Japanese tea kettle. I love how friendly the staff is, I love how delicious the food is. I love EVERYTHING ABOUT this place! \n\nEvery time Sushi tomo comes up in a conversation I am quick to praise them! Do yourself a favor and get to sushi tomo if you have never been there or if you are having doubts about wether or not it is good because it is!!!! \n\nThis place has the Will Koz seal of approval! One of my favorite go to Chinese places in a pinch. Great for takeout especially. Food is typical of Chinese restaurants in the area. They have a few different locations. This location is a little annoying because if parking. It is also located on an upper level which could be a problem for some of you can't ascend stairs. Prices are pretty average. I've only ever had the chicken and broccoli, general tso's, sweet and sour chicken and orange chicken. All dishes were good and would get again. The food is always pretty consistent and has never been bad. Large portions too! As much as I like to avoid a franchise restaurant, this is one of our go-to place for american-Chinese cuisine. I guess I'll take solace in the fact that I am still supporting a local franchise :) \n\nThe place itself is pretty spacious and ideal for groups. They have two different seating areas including a full bar at the main area. The place is clean and the servers and service so far has been pretty good.\n\nThe food especially their in house specialties and traditional dishes are really good. No disrespect to the chef but if you're in the mood for the Pad thai or Sushi - I suggest you go to a thai or a Japanese restaurant.\n\nSo far during my visit here, I've had the Mongolian Beef/Pork, Amazing Chicken, General Tso ofcourse, Sesame Chicken, Mapo Tofu, Singaporean Noodles (don't recommend), Fried Rice, Lomein to name a few. I highly recommend the Mongolian Beef or Pork. Also, the portions served during the dinner hours are huge and reasonably priced - so order accordingly. Excellent place and within walking distance from home makes it's a favorite place! I have nothing bad whatsoever to write about. The food, service and quality is perfect. Their General Tso's Chicken is better than most Chinese restaurants in the area. When I visit various Chinese restaurants, I tend to always order the General Tso's to try to find which restaurant has the best in Pittsburgh. For $9, their lunch special is a pretty good deal, and you get a good portion of chicken, rice, and an egg roll. Overall, I would say the Sesame Inn is above average, and a good spot to pick up lunch if you are in the mood for some Chinese food. I've had better Mexican cuisine in Robinson. It's reasonably priced but if I had to choose between this place and another place in Robinson, I'd choose a different place. Just saying, they are okay, definitely not the best. Great place to eat and the atmosphere is friendly. Went on a Friday night and even though it was busy we got seated and served quickly Worst lunch I ever had at SHV and be the last time I ever eat there again . The service suck all around the wait time was almost 25 min s .Steak sandwich was full of grease and they put to much mayo on Two different workers put mayo on sandwich . The counter space was dirty and there were no napkins and the worker hand me French fries that were sitting there for 25 min s I had to ask for fresh ones then the Pepsi was all water down had to go back and be  told it was all run out after I drank some ,very bad service and not any of the 3 workers apologize .and I will let everyone know about my service. We moved here from Texas and this is probably the best Mexican food we've had since we arrived.  Delicious complementary chips and salsa.  Drink specials every day ($2.50 XX beer tonight).  My park tacos with roasted pineapple we're on points.  Nothing to complain about.  Will be back soon! When you start out with salsa as amazing as they have, you know it can only get better! Friendly wait staff and super tasty food. After multiple visits, everyone in our party has thoroughly enjoyed their dinner fare. I highly recommend the tacos al pastor or their empanadas. I've re-ordered both a few times. I was not super impressed with their House margaritas, but the food makes up for it. It's also quite large and even though it gets very busy, we have never had to wait too long to be seated. However long we have waited, it was worth it. Came here for the first time over the weekend. They have a large menu with lots of sandwich choices (plus pizza, seafood, and fries) I ended up getting the club and Italian hogie to go. The menu says all sandwiches come with a pickle and chips. I asked about that when I noticed my to go order didn't have those. The woman told me that's only when you eat in.... What?!? Then I should have paid less? She was nice and got me a side of chips to go. Minus the side issue, the sandwiches were on point. Made fresh with tons of meat. The place itself is very outdated as far as the searing area. It's definitely stuck in the 90s. Some small updates would go very far. I plan on stopping in again to eat in this time and get my pickle and chips. Ha. I've had many friends tell me to try here if looking for a seafood joint. Now some friends think way differently when saying joint but that's another blog. \nThis place is smaller but adequate which I hear often from the wife. Haa. The broiled fish sandwich was delicious even though I passed on the bun. Trust me I have enough buns on me. The wife had fried fish sammich and I stole a sliver. It too was very good as was the calamari appetizer which comes in 3 sizes and we ordered a medium which was plenty for 4 of us. \nThe kiddos had a steak sandwich which she only ate maybe half of and the other rug rat had the fish sticks and he said they were really really really good. You can order the meal which throws in some fries and Cole slaw. \nI'm looking forward to trying their dinners here and having a drink from the bar which you have to walk through to the dining room. The wait staff were exceptionally funny and courteous. This place is worth a visit and every penny. Nice, clean room & really good food but of course pricey since it's connected to the airport. I would stay here again. After a few days of 2 degree weather, the second that it hit above 30 degrees, we decided it was time for a well deserved ice cream date. I ordered Graham Central Station which Is a graham cracker flavor ice cream with chocolate covered crunchies (graham cracker pieces?) here and there. It was good.. very sweet but good. I ordered it in a waffle cone. \n\nMy bf always asks workers for suggestions. The cashier said his favorite was Caramel Pretzel Crunch. It is salted caramel ice cream that has contains caramel swirls and chocolate covered pretzels pieces (!!!) it was delicious and I was so jealous of his cone. I highly recommend that flavor. The guy working the stand was nice. *They sell doggie treats! \n\nIn a world surrounded by fro-yo and bubble tea, give me ice cream, sundaes & banana splits. The service I received here at this location was by far the worst. We arrived around 9:30pm while we knew the place would close at 10pm but thought no big deal because it's still open. My fianc\u00e9 and I were greeted with a waitress that was gossiping to her co-worker that we wanted to dine in instead of just get food to go.  We sat there some but after she waited and stood for me to review the menu, we ordered. We saw the staff of the whole restaurant practically staring at us wondering why we were there. Well is my birthday and if I want steak I should get it. After all, it's my day. Well, we finally had had enough and asked the waitress to just make it a to go order and we were able to take the food and leave. Only reason this review is two stars was that the food was great. I'd recommend to go orders and never deal with such a rude staff that has 0 skills in the customer service industry. I have been there twice now. The first time I purchase the ribeye and it came out cold and I didn't send it back. The second time I went there I purchase the ribeye again and I ordered it medium rare rare, but it came out medium well. I sent it back and they gave me a rare steak. Both times I was surprised that the ribeye was very thin, as if someone pushes it down when cooking. My wife cooks ribeye all the time and I eat ribeye out a lot so I do know what it's supposed to taste and look like. There was very little flavor at all, it was too thin, so I won't be going back. Very ecstatic this Roadhouse opened in late October. We met for a guys night out before Christmas and had a party of 12. The staff were very accommodating and since we had a large party we had to be split into two tables, but were right next to each other. \n\nThe bread and butter spread is to die for and the chili is amazing. I got the dinner combo consisting of grilled BBQ chicken and a sirloin steak that came with two sides. I got chili and steak fries. It was all amazing. My buddies enjoyed their meals also. \n\nGreat location and awesome customer service. Cannot wait to go back!!!! Fun time in the VIP room, but everything except the bathrooms is updated and they are gross!! Do your business before you come. Don't take the risk!! Ok. Before you are heading out, ask yourself a few questions....\n\n1) do I have children\n2) do I like fried foods\n3) do I want to step on a 3 year olds finger near the arcade space\n\nIf you can answer yes to all three of these questions, this place is for you! Soooo many kids. So many unsupervised kids. This place actually made me very nervous. My husband and I ventured out to this location for our nephews birthday party. We have a 3 month old, so we took him along. I literally almost tripped over multiple kids. The staff were not saying to any of the children, don't run, don't lay on the floor...it was just a free for all. \n\nThe food was o k. It is all fried. They have a couple of salads. I don't recommend coming too hungry because you will just eat a bunch of snacks. \n\nIt's a bit messy as well. I believe I saw a couple gnats at the bar. \n\nNow the 8 year old whose party it was loved it. They have a nice party room in the back where kids can host functions. They assign waitstaff for your particular party and they are to help with everything. The young lady assigned to us did just that. I am very sorry to say Pittsburgh, but skip this cupcake spot.\n\nI had Toasted Coconut.   The icing was TOO SWEET, you can taste the granulated sugar.  The almond cake was dry.   The filling did not match the favors in the cupcake.\n\nYuck. Our family got cupcakes from Gigi's over the holidays; everybody thought they were great. I was particularly impressed by the cake section - it was moist and extremely tasty, almost as if there were fillings, but there weren't. I know the foods actually are good.But I still have to say,you really forgot my pepsi!!!! We like the ambiance and quiet of this charming old inn, but find the food less than memorable. We've eaten there four or five times, usually because other places are closed. Each time we remember how poor the food is. Undercooked bread, bland soup,  boring menu. Too bad.  Also it is quite expensive. My boyfriend and I both had dinner here for the first time tonight. We sat at the bar, as we usually do. Angie took care of us and she was great! We talked, laughed, and joked the whole time. The food was excellent, as well. He got the strip steak and I had crab cakes. We will definitely be back! Wow and I am saying WOW! I'm sorry but the wok in heaven with the old owners was and I mean the best but now its a tragedy ... Food is bland either under or over cooked rice taste like ( no words had to use the emoji) they say they also offer delivery but never have some one to deliver please bring back the old owners their legacies are at stake. Great wings, actual full size 3 part wing, not the standard miniature  wing.\n\nGreat service and cheap beer. Like Mexican food and often eat at Chipotle. The food is absolutely fantastic/crave-worthy. Flavorful, not over-sauced, good portions, etc. The salt and pepper calamari is wonderful (especially the dipping sauce!) as well as the Mongolian beef. Unfortunately, the service at this location is really hit-or-miss...usually a miss. Lots of empty drinks, long waits and attitudes. The waterfront location, although always super busy, has much better odds for good service and is worth a visit for sure!", "stars": 3.6}, "Allentown": {"year": 2017, "text": "YUM!  Be prepared for lots of delicious food--my boyfriend and I made two full meals with the leftovers after we left.  The meatball was AMAZING and was probably my favorite thing there--but it is hard to pick, with the heavenly Holy Oil and pasta. They somehow made a standard garden salad anything but ordinary.  I was too full to eat the main course, but I enjoyed it the next day.  My boyfriend made the reservation for us and told them it was my birthday--they printed out a special menu just for me!  This restaurant is expensive, but you really are getting three delicious meals for the price. Still love this place, it's become the \"birthday go-to\" for my boyfriend and I.  We tried to follow up with this tradition on Saturday--when I called to see if we could get a reservation I was told Saturdays book up a month and a half ahead of time!  So I just thought I'd send out this tip.  Don't let that scare you away, still the best Italian food ever, but if you're not the best planner (like us) then try heading to Alla Famiglia on a weeknight. GOOD LUCK....So I am going to cut to the chase....The Food was FANTASTIC.....However this would be a 5Star restaurant if they could work on their service!!!! This food needs and deserves service to match! The service was poor and the communication lacking. The appetizers were brought out before the bread!!! The three dishes for the bread were never explained until all the bread was gone .... not a big deal. But the two filet gorgonzola that came out and sat on the table for 10 minutes before the veal entree and last but not least.....the Pasta Bolognese  ...Yes that was last!  And the waitress had no answer to why 1/2 the tables food came out 10 minutes prior. When she asked if I wanted to speak to the Manager I explained \"no I just want to know why the meals were brought out individually\" she stated \"I don't know why\" when I did speak with the Manager I wasn't even allowed to explain the situation....constant interruptions .....and was never allowed to describe the situation.....GREAT FOOD !! HORRIBLE SERVICE AND MANAGER! Theresa was to busy hanging in the bar talking to other patrons at the bar.....who she didn't realize were with our group. Great diner!  Food tastes fresh and portions are large.  They have a basic breakfast and lunch menu that they do very well (instead of a huge menu where everything is so-so), but the gold star goes to their breakfast burritos.  Huge and packed with good stuff!  Prices are very reasonable and staff is friendly, but not hovering.  It's never been super-busy when we've been there.  It looks like they've made some improvements to the dining area since last time we were in - it seemed a lot brighter.  The neighborhood is undergoing a bit of revitalization, but don't let that keep you away.  It's just a few minutes off Route 51 or Arlington Ave and located on a main road.  Parking is very close and easy on the side streets.  There's a good mix of locals, but you don't get that \"outsider\" feeling.  Really hope this place stays around for awhile.", "stars": 4.2}, "Arlington": {"year": 2016, "text": "Fantastic homemade breakfast!  All food is fresh and made to order.

Clean inside seating,nice outdoor seating once weather warms up.  Workers are very attentive and friendly.  Pricing is very affordable and the portions are generous.  Went two times already, some variability in the spice \"scale\", but otherwise a great restaurant. I am not the biggest fan of Indian food. I think you need to know that before reading further. This place is really good!! Great flavors with a terrific selection. Great for veggies. The staff was super nice and helped me to find good options. They are BYOB for now. Oh....The spice level on each dish can be tailored to your palate. Try it! I think you will be very pleased with this new choice in Aspinwall. Stopped by here for their lunch buffet and was not disappointed at all. Greeted warmly as I entered and tried various items on the buffet. Fresh hot and authentic Northern Indian food. I should know as I am Indian. My favourite was the malai chicken kebab and the chicken makhini was tender and flavorful. \n\nThe hot chai and rice pudding for dessert hit the spot. I will be coming back for sure. Great location in the heart of Aspinwall and only 10 minutes to drive from downtown. \n\nTry this new place. The service and food is exceptional and I had great service by Vic. Very exceptional all the way around. Very authentic Indian food prepared fresh and delicious. They have a full page of vegetarian options. \n\nThe spice level the use (1-10) is essentially the same as People's Restaurant. \n\nWe had an excellent vegetarian appetizer sampler plate that I highly recommend.\n\nPortions are generous. Prices are very reasonable.\n\nThey have an authentic clay open used to bake traditional breads.\n\nRomantic decor and no corkage fee (BYOB). We had the cauliflower appetizer and the samosas.  The cauliflower was amazing.  The chicken makhni and palak paneer were delicious as was the lamb biryani. So happy to have an Indian restaurant in the area. We FINALLY have an Indian food restaurant in our neighborhood...yayyyyy! I have already visited four or five times since they opened last month (yeah, this might become a problem!), mostly for takeout.\n\nSo far I've tried their chicken tikka masala, chicken vindaloo, malai kafta, aloo matar, naan, and veggie samosas. I've been quite pleased with the food. Their sauces are really flavorful and creamy without being too rich or heavy. The chicken has always been perfectly tender in the meat dishes. And their veggie samosas may be the best I've ever had. Their naan is the one item that I think could use some improvement. I've always ordered the garlic naan, and some of the time it's tasted a little tough without much garlic flavor, almost like it wasn't fresh. Other times, the naan has been chewy, soft, fluffy, and packed with garlic flavor like good garlic naan should be. \n\nTrue to their name, they certainly include lots of flavor and spice in their dishes, although I have found their heat scale to be a little inconsistent (you can choose your desired spice level from 1-10).  I tend to like things on the spicier side (not burn-your-tongue-off spicy, but enough to break me into a minor league sweat). Depending on the day, the heat levels seem to differ. I've had everything from a level 7 that barely tickled my tongue to a level 5 that had me reaching for the water several times during my meal. So until they get a little more consistent with their heat, I'd recommend going conservative on your spice level selection.\n\nEvery time we've ordered takeout, our food has been ready within 20 minutes and the workers were very friendly when we came to pick it up. The food is also always packaged very thoughtfully, which is a nice touch (e.g., plastic wrap around the take out containers to avoid the dreaded soggy-bottom-of-the-bag-due-to-sauce-spillage).\n\nMost new restaurants have growing pains and need to work out the kinks at the beginning, so it bodes well that my experiences here have been positive right out of the gate. I must admit that this is still not my favorite Indian food in the 'Burgh (at least not yet), but it definitely holds its own. Considering that this is a short walk away from me, they will continue to see a lot of my hungry face in the future. I can't wait to try their lunch buffet. Oh, two final nuggets of info...it's BYOB and they also deliver! I went here for brunch on New Year's Day and it did not disappoint one bit.  I had a pickle spice Bloody Mary which was as unique as it was bold and delicious.  I chose a potato pancake benny and it was scrumptious, everyone in my party was happy with their dishes but the flavor of the potato pancake may have won over another fan with an offered bite.  Excellent corned beef was part of the benny. Wowwww!!! This is our new favorite restaurant!!!! I wish this place was closer to home! Thanks to Yelp, we found this place! \n\nOur transition to a vegan lifestyle has been easy so far! We definitely love this clean life, but the only problem is finding a restaurant like this close to home! I'm glad we found this place! We will definitely be coming back here. This restaurant is located in aspinwall near the police station so it's pretty easy to find. The building sticks out and easy to spot. There is on street metered parking as well as a public lot a few hundred feet away. \n\nThis place is a small restaurant so big parties might be a little difficult to accommodate. They have a few tables around the restaurant and a bar area with 4-5 stools. The restaurant is very clean and has a modern feel. The service is top notch and nothing to complain about. \n\nThe menu is great, it has everything we could possibly want!! So for us, this was like winning the lottery!!' We were definitely excited to see the options for clean eating! My wife went with the African Peanut Stew which was out of this world!! She also got a taco salad and it was awesome too! I went with the veggie burger with a side of lime cilantro dressing as my sauce and grilled veggies! The dressing was AMAZING!!! Well so was the burger and veggies!!! We figured we should spoil ourselves and go with some coconut cream pie as well! That was to die for, the crust was delicious and the pie was great with the coconut chips on top!! We left full, and can't wait to go back!\n\nWow is all I gotta say!!  We can't wait to come back!!

I recommend simply driving a little farther to the next Arby's. There is many in the area. Ordered an eggless cake from their 'bakery' section- and it was awesome. We wanted the cake to be of a normal design without too much flowery stuff- and it was perfect - not too ordinary and not too designy. Tasted awesome too. I would have loved not to interact with those part time waiters who turn up on weekends to help. They have no clue what they are talking about and sound as they are the CEOs of some IT companies who happened to do some 'welfare' activity. He took his own sweet time to pack the cake- didnt know where the boxes were, etc. The food here is consistently good, though it takes some effort to convince them to make the food extremely spicy, if you like that. If they aren't convinced, they will just give you the spice level they think you can handle, instead of what you asked for. Now that our household is recognized by the manager they feel free to go heavy on the spices.\n\nThe dining area is comfortable enough, which is impressive considering that it's obviously converted from a mechanic's garage.\n\nThey used to have incredible peshwari naan, but they changed chefs, who changed the recipe. Now it's nothing special. Their sizzler plates are particularly good.", "stars": 3.0}, "Beechview": {"year": 2017, "text": "There are not enough superlative words in the English language to accurately describe the most delicious, tasty, real, down home, authentic Mexican cuisine one will find almost anywhere in the United States let alone Pittsburgh itself. In fact, the entire experience is a genuine blast which will instantly, if only temporarily, transport you to Mexico City.\n\nTo begin, this review can be difficult to understand (and explain) unless you have (A.) been to El Milagro as a patron or (B.) spent time living the life most Mexicans live in Mexico (and don't count time spent in a secluded resort at Riviera Maya). \n\nFirst, walking into El Milagro is akin to walking into a local \"5 & 10\" neighborhood store from yesteryear.  I write this because the store is not set up to be what most think as a traditional restaurant.  The store is old with little decoration but has beautiful, newer El Milagro signage, a squeaky door which has a padlock on it, and no host or hostess or even a \"seat yourself\" sign.  Once you've entered you will most likely see a group of the working class Hispanic community having fun and devouring the most incredible food anywhere north of the border. Help yourself by proceeding to the beverage cooler and selecting anything to drink from inside.  Generally, the options are bottled water, glass bottled Coca Cola, and several flavors of glass bottled Jarritos (bottle opener near cash register). After choosing your drink(s), seat yourself.  Don't expect perfectly new tables, soft cushioned booths and lively music in the background.  There are old tables and chairs (a few non-padded booths by the giant bin of jalapeno peppers at the cash register) with either one or two large televisions that may or may not be turned on. If ambiance or fine interior decor are part of one's checklist to a fantastic meal you will need to rethink your requirements because El Milagro's food far surpasses restaurants with even the snootiest of decoration.   \n\nOnce seated, you'll be visited by a cook/chef/server (most likely functioning as all of the above at once) with some menus.  If you don't speak Spanish don't have a panic attack. After you begin to read you'll see most of their menus have dishes descriptions written in English underneath the Spanish.  The items on the menu are impressive and as authentic as Oaxaca itself.  This menu has been tailored to versatility with so much to choose from you could order new dishes for weeks upon weeks. Believe me, you aren't going to find burrito el jefe, guacamole with shallots or yellow cheese.  Many people won't believe their American eyes and may question things but they'll be wrong to do so because those who do have never had food from a true Mexican kitchen .... til now.\n\nOnce you've chosen from one of the many authentic meals available you'll place your order at your table with someone who may speak a little bit of English.  Please be precise, careful and order slowly to make sure they understand exactly what you want.  El Milagro caters any dish to how you prefer so be pleasant but exact.  The service is slow at times depending on how many diners are there, time of day and the kitchen staff.  Patience is a virtue and you will be well rewarded. \n\nPersonally, I order tortilla chips with salsa with most of my meals here (no, this restaurant does not serve free refillable drinks & endless pre-made chips like many places).  El Milagro has several salsas all of which are fresh as can be and as true to their roots as the sun is to earth.  Their salsas are fantastic but beware as traditional salsas are often very spicy to the Pittsburgh palate and theirs are no exception. And, as a side note of interest, El Milagro will bring you green salsa unless you specify another type. In my opinion, their green salsa is the best salsa (in any style) Pittsburgh has to offer, hands down.  The tortilla chips will be freshly cut, fried and piping hot. As simple as it is, this is pure culinary heaven (if you believe in that sort of thing).  \n\nOnce you are served your meal, you'll instantly be able to tell your authentic, home style meal is made to 100% made to order with Mexican love, fresh ingredients, and no short cuts or American liberties. They cook their food as it should be and is made in Mexico.  And, it will taste and smell absolutely AMAZING.\n\nIn my experience at El Milagro, I've had at least three dozen meals many of which come with rice and beans. Check that, true rice and real beans ... not yellow rice and refried beans. \n\nEVERY SINGLE DISH I'VE HAD WAS A FRESH, PERFECT CULINARY MASTERPIECE FROM A REAL MEXICAN KITCHEN.\n\nBy the way and this is important, you'll have to pay CASH ONLY at the register at your convenience.  El Milagro is moderately priced and will never hurry you along by presenting a bill. \n\nAbsolutely the VERY BEST.  No local comparisons since El Milagro far surpasses everyone else. The food deserves much more than 5 stars. RECOMMENDED. The only reason I won't give this 5 stars is because it is not fancy at all!!!  I'm s a bare bones operation, but don't be afraid. The food is authentic and very good.  Spice level is high.  Beware of the complimentary sauces placed on the table. Slice has the best Margherita pizza, and the staff is always super friendly. This is our favorite pizza spot in town! I get steak salads about twice a week. Julie has an awesome personality and she makes great salads. Literally just went through the drive through.these people want all this money to work a fast food joint but can't even count to 6 nor can they  put a sauce in a bag. I ordered a 6 piece chicken nugget...only got 5 and asked for a sweet and sour sauce and got NONE!....but they want more money..bring in the machines. I've been going to Fiori's for 20-plus years never ever a problem but the last couple times I go there they forget your order they expect you to stand there and wait on their mess up I was just in there for 55 minutes to get two pizzas and it still wasn't ready when they tell you 20 on the phone it's on believable anymore that place used to be the best place in the city now it's one of the worst the food's great but the customer service sucks thank you telling you one more minute one more minute and then 30 minutes past so after 55 minutes I'm still leaving with no food unbelievable I can go spend $20 a pizza anywhere in the city you would think for the price you charge for food they would actually take care of their customers", "stars": 4.1}, "Bellevue": {"year": 2016, "text": "This is a great little shop!  The prices are pretty comparable to Starbucks, but instead of supporting a giant chain you are supporting a small community business.\nThere are a few tables inside and a few out front on the street.  It is small, though, and doesn't have the typical \"coffee shop\" feel.\nFor a small shop, they have a nice size menu. A wide variety of flavors for every type of drink and even several varieties of pumpkin spice.  There is also coffee, water and a variety of pastries.  \nThe staff was friendly and answered questions about the products and took customization requests without any issues.\nI enjoyed my visit and will return if I'm in the neighborhood again. Although the staff is very friendly, I would say this place is just ok, nothing to rave about. Prices are a bit high for the quality. There is very limited seating and it feels crammed and a bit claustrophobic at times. They literally have every flavor you could think of and they taste just as good if not better than Starbucks. The staff is always patient with me since I'm so indecisive and overwhelmed by their choices. Every drink I've  had, from pumpkin lattes to frozen drinks that taste like almond joys, have been delicious. Go next door and grab a cookie from Good L'oven to pair with your coffee! You usually can't go wrong with a quick, inexpensive meal from a classic restaurant like Eat N Park. We usually eat breakfast here which is always fast and hot. Dinner we almost always do carry out. When picking up carry out they open up every box to make sure you get everything you ordered. While you wait they also offer you a drink which is great hospitality! Staff is super friendly and kind. I love the new building design.. modern with a retro flair!  The parking lot is larger and more space for parking..   A new take out window has been added (along the right side of the building).  If dining inside, your server takes care of the bill for you and brings the receipt to the table. In the past one would go to the hostess stand to pay their bill.  \n\nI love this newly revamped Eat n Park location! I don't understand why the staff is completely defective on the late night shift. Every time I've come here after work (late), the waitresses disappear faster than Houdini, can't get an order right, or are just flat out rude or terrible. I work in Hospitality - either the owner should completely reassess this location or shut it down & let an actual decent restaurant take its place. Sad because the other locations are decent. Possibly the worst \"pulled pork\" I have ever been served....basically boiled pork with no discernible smoke flavor, nor, for that matter, much pork flavor.  The chicken had a nice crisp skin, but, again, no smoke flavor whatsoever, and a rather bitter aftertaste.  The sides were bland, the sauces boring.\n\nDo not eat here, even under threat of death. I've been meaning to try this place for awhile, and I really want to like it, but I just can't.  I got a half-rack with the Korean sauce, and mac and cheese along with mashed red potatos for the sides.  The best part of the meal were the potatos, quite tasty.  The mac and cheese had very little cheese flavor, and a raw flour taste.  The ribs were the biggest disappointment, the sauce had little flavor, and the ribs were badly overdone and as dry as the Griswald's Christmas turkey.  \n\nI see many positive reviews, so maybe I just caught them on a bad day.  Perhaps next time I'll try a more traditional sauce. Delicious! Best BBQ I've had in Pittsburgh. My bf and I called in for a to go order. It was ready quickly and piping hot when we picked it up. He got the smoked ribs with red skin mashed potatoes and cornbread. The potatoes in particular were SO good. I got a Cuban with Mac and cheese and green beans. Everything we got was AMAZING. Will definitely be eating there again soon. I was a little disappointed in the food quality. The Cuban sandwich that I ordered was completely flavorless. When I order wings, I like for them to be cooked a little harder and to have a slight crunch on the outside. The wings that we ordered from here also seemed as if they weren't the freshest.\n Like a previous reviewer stated, don't order from here thinking that you're getting soul food, because you'll be sorely disappointed\nThe pluses do include fast delivery and ordering available via Grub hub. Dave Thomas would turn over in his grave!  Dirty everywhere, from the kitchen to the dining area to the restrooms!  The person behind the counter when I visited yesterday, August 21, 2016, just did not want to be there, and certainly did not want to be bothered with a customer.  The burger was not hot and juicy, but cold and dry, with unrequested mustard on it.\n\nOh, and did I mention that there were no napkins in the restaurant, either behind the counter or in the dining room!\n\nI knew both Dave Thomas and Jim Near, and I ate in the first Wendy's in Columbus, Ohio.  I find this a sad time for Wendy's.  It's good that Dave and Jim are not around to see what happened to the business they dedicated their lives to.\n\nIt would be a miracle if the Wendy's board could find a CEO who is capable of turning this around.  I think it is too late! Worst fast food I've ever been to. A couple years ago, this was a nice place. It took a long time for someone to answer the drive thru and then the guy working the drive thru was very hard to understand like he had food in his mouth and basically clueless. Once our order was finally understood, it then took a very long time to get our food. I thought we were overcharged, but rather than deal with the clueless gentleman I decided to just move on. Dear Wendy's,\nToday I was very disappointed with the drive-thru service.\n\nI was excited to see the taco salad back on the menu. I ordered the salad along with a junior fry and small green tea. At the window I paid for my meal and was handed my drink (without a straw). The service seemed slower than usual and it took a few minutes before I was handed my bag of food. I glanced inside to see if there was a straw but since there wasn't, I asked for one and then drove off.\n\nI've gave a rating of 2 stars because the French fries were piping hot, fresh and delicious. \n\nHowever, I did not receive tortilla chips with my taco salad. I did not receive a fork or other utensils. I also did not get a receipt with my meal. I tried to call the store twice this afternoon to speak with a manager and the line has been busy. This was not your best service and I hope it can be improved for the future. \n\nSincerely,\nA disappointed customer I love this Giant Eagle.  Ok so its not Market District or anything but has everything I need and I am in and out. .. rock star parking every time!!  I like that its smaller - which is more convenient in way.  I dont browse when I grocery shop- I am like lighting.   I also love the redbox outside - they always have movies available that I cant find anywhere else. \n\nThe one thing I noticed today is that they offer rotisserie chicken but not fried!! I am a fool for Giant Eagle fried chicken.. it must be a Market District thing.. still one of my stores..  Thanks Giant Eagle... This is an older, more \"basic\" Giant Eagle that is located near my home in Brighton Heights.  I am giving them 3.5 stars because I am really pleased that this store is starting to carry more organic and healthy products and I want to encourage others in the area to support their efforts by buying these products here.  While the organic offerings are more limited than the larger Market District stores and not what you can find at the East End Food Co-op, Trader Joe's and Whole Foods, they have a lot of basic natural and organic \"necessities\" like lettuce, spinach, carrots, celery, apples, lemons, some berries, free range eggs, etc.  They also recently started carrying GT's kombucha as well as a few other specialty and organic drinks/juices.  They will only be able to continue to carry these expanded options if people buy them, so I hope that this continues to grow as awareness grows.\n\nThe overall store is usually relatively clean and the employees are nice.  I find myself shopping here more often now that they are offering a wider selection of healthy options and that tides me over until I can get to one of the other stores where I will do my primary shopping. My pup and I love to drive through the BeanThru! They have super friendly staff and the convenience of getting coffee quickly without leaving your car. Love the chocolate covered coffee/espresso bean treats on top of the drinks. Great place to drive thru and get coffee, tea, or whatever you like. The service is always great and friendly. And the coffee and tea are excellent. My fave is the Green Tea Chai Latte! Listen: this would be 10 stars if possible! Fantastic coffee, cappuccino and a.m./afternoon slump cures, including a killer brewed redeye that cured my LA-NYC-PIT globe trotting jet lag! The real bonus here, (aside from bitching awesome biscotti and those adorable chocolate covered espresso beans you put on my cups lids-could we all kiss the face of the Java GENIUS who thought of that!!), is the PEOPLE! This place hires THE BEST people! I've only ever encountered genuine smiles and have never seen that grouchy \"Ihatethisjob\" look you get a virtually every coffee spot, (especially drive throughs!). Never. Always pleasant! Like they're actually happy, nice people! (Are they are like yoga instructors?! Is there a secret spa in that shack?! So chill! So glowing!), and mad generous-I think it's easily one of my favorite places to hit up while in Pittsburgh. Trendy, but never pretentious! Get there in time though-they open and close like clockwork! (As it should be) \n\nMy only request: can you please start making Cortados? We all would buy ohhhh so many if you did! I realized I had never written a review for the Bean Thru when my friend stopped me mid-rave and said \"I know. You've mentioned them before. A lot.\"\n...so I guess it's past time to put it out there.\n\nI love this place. I used to work in Beaver Co, so I was back and forth on 65 a lot, and this place saved me from starvation and caffeine withdrawals numerous times. Very speedy service and super friendly staff. Love their mochas and almond milk lattes, and the breakfast burritos are pretty awesome too. The candy espresso bean is the perfect way to top off the drink.\n\nTry to make it here!! Cute, quick little drive through coffee hut.  I stop here for an Americano every AM.  This has replaced my morning Starbucks coffee run and is just as quick.  If there is more than one car in line, the super friendly staff usually comes out to take your order.  The espresso tastes amazing.  Seems to be great quality.  They'll give you a chocolate coffee bean on top of your drink too :-) My absolutely FAVORITE coffee in the Burgh. The white chocolate mocha is out of this world. Pair that with an apple crumb muffin and you've got yourself a delicious breakfast on the go! I have never been disappointed here. The staff is absolutely incredible as well-always so kind and welcoming! I love this little stand! The coconut mocha chiller and caramel macchiato are delicious. The espresso is smooth and amazing. The chocolate chip cookies are a definite must-have. The prices are comparable to other coffee shops and their service is very friendly too.  We're so happy to have found this gem so close to home! Roadside coffee stand easily accessed on Rt65. This place serves iced and hot coffee, teas, smoothies, and baked goods. The baristas there are really great and will make you whatever you like, plus they're all real pretty. Nice list of menu choices which all soind way better than any $tarb*cks. Every coffee comes with a choc covered espresso bean! Great spot. Coffee is delicious and the staff is always friendly. We go out of our way and pass many other places to stop here and get a cup of coffee. I love Bean Thru. I've been stopping since they were first purchased. I am a huge fan of their extensive list of sugar free flavorings. My favorite item has to be their iced latte's w skim milk & sugar free syrup. Or the same item served blended. Bean Thru stands out because of their baristas ability to blend up amazing drinks quickly with a diverse list of ingredients to meet the needs of the most discerning customer. We ordered one Americano (Black drip coffee), one cappuccino, and one mocha. All three of the coffees tasted watered down and just average. I've had better coffee elsewhere. The breakfast burrito's are very small and not very tasty. Favorite mid afternoon coffee stop on my way out of the city. Awesome staff. And the best item is the peanut butter oat bars! Just order one! Amazing gem of a place along 65/Ohio River Boulevard. Drive through coffee that's quick and expertly made. I'm a latte and chai tea person and they have some of the best chai tea in Pittsburgh. \n\nCoffee is made fresh and hot and the espresso bean that comes atop every cup is and sweet treat. \n\nThe cars lined up during peak hours shouldn't dissuade you but they should be a testament to the loyal customer base. Lines move fast and they get you in and out. Stopped at this little hole in the wall cabin  for an iced coffee. The barista was a god send and made exactly what I normally order at DD after I explained it to her. \n\nThe result was perfect. The chocolate covered expresso bean is a nice touch, and delicious. Definitely will stop here again if needing a quick caffeine fix. Friendly staff, quick drive through, reasonably priced, they have a punch card, and I've never had a bad drink. I was all set to make dinner tonight, but when I went to put the dang casserole in the oven, the stupid thing wouldn't turn on. I tried everything but to no avail. I decided it was going to be a pizza night and began looking for a local place that I hadn't tried yet. Neighbors recommended Ephesus, so I figured I'd give it a try. I went to the website which directed me to GrubHub. The process was so easy. I was able to view their menu, make my selections, pay and tip through the app, which this introverted tech savvy lady sure did appreciate. They said to expect it between 7:20 pm and 7:30 pm. It got here at 7:15, I crushed nearly half of it, and have time to write about it. I ordered a small pepperoni pizza. It came with ranch dipping sauce that apparently god himself made right after he created light. The pizza was delivered by a friendly guy and was piping hot even though it is fricken freezing outside. Pizza delivery doesn't get much better than this folks. Oh, did I mention that it was D-fricken-licious? No? Okay, well it was. I like gooey cheese, bready dough (not crispy) and it had both. I can't wait to try their other menu items. Gyros, falafel, baklava, delivered? Yes please! Delicious seafood pizza with alfredo sauce.  Their wings are the bees knees-I get the garlic and mild mixed together.  Extra ranch too...always on point and always friendly fast service. The pizza is great but the delivery time is ridicule and the driver always has a attitude. Man, we used to love Ephesus. The food was high quality, the prices were great, and the staff were wonderful people. However, all that's gone now. Quality of ingredients has declined over the past year. New staff are rude, and try to nickel and dime you. For example, in the the good ole Ephesus days, they would let you know if something you ordered had a coupon. Now, they fight you about coupons when you bring them up. The pides used to be amazing and fresh, and now they're barely edible. The Lamajun was so good! Now they don't even include lamb in it. The salads used to be great, with spring mix. Now it's 90% ice berg ends. I miss the old Ephesus. Now we have to find a new pizza joint... Food is slightly higher than average prices, but the quality is terrible. There are tons of better places in the area for cheaper. Pellegrino and Monte Cellos are two good examples. The sandwich we got was terrible. Mostly bread and burnt cheese. The salad was soggy. The pizza was gross. I placed an order for delivery yesterday evening from the Bellevue location. When I received my order, I found half of what I ordered was missing. I called and spoke to the manager thinking he would apologize and send the remainder of the order. Instead, he was rude and accused me of lying to him about what I originally ordered! I am appalled with his belligerence and disrespectful behavior toward a customer. I will never order from Ephesus again. Standard Pittsburgh pizza shop. Edible pizza, standard apps, iceberg salads. \n\nConvenient, and prompt. They will often day 45 mins for a delivery and its there in 15.\n\nDelivery drivers are polite and respectful, and seemingly quite friendly. Great for delivery, usually have coupons or specials that make it very affordable. Very good specialty pizza. The Moroccan chicken is my favorite: spiced chicken, some sort of dried fruit, sriracha, and goat cheese, finished with almonds and lettuce. Sounds bizarre but it's absolutely delicious. \n\nThe plain pizza, however, is pretty underwhelming. The crust wasn't very crisp, the sauce kind of bland, and the cheese was unremarkable. While I appreciate a good gourmet pie, I feel a pizza should be able to stand alone without fancy toppings. \n\nThe gourmet pies are pretty pricey, and I wish they offered occasional coupons in the local circulars. Also a $1 delivery fee, at least if you order through Grubhub. The pizza is very good. High quality cheese, plenty of options for toppings (if you're into that), and they deliver fairly quickly. They also have online ordering, which shouldn't be a big deal in 2016 yet is in Pittsburgh (go figure). Will definitely keep ordering. Ephesus is the best pizza in the Bellevue/Avalon area. When my husband and I moved, we were sad to be leaving our beloved pizza shop in Bloomfield. Oh, how I miss their delicious sauce, thin crust, and greasy cheese! Since our move, we have tried every pizza place around. Though we have yet to find any pizza we love, Ephesus is our go-to these days. The sauce is good and the crust is fairly thick and fluffy, though thinner than most pizza shops. Pizza is tastes and hits the spot. Great convenient drive thru stop for coffee.  Double ordering stations minimize the wait time for your order.  Service is always pleasant and reliable.  \n\nI noticed that the dining room looks spacious and they have  an indoor play area for children. Great service, great hours and good prices. The staff is always very friendly and they have a great selection. The also have the Collector Cave and it's is awesome if you collect Funco Pop's. They have a lot of common and hard to find Pop's in the Cave of wonders. I highly recommend this place to everyone I know.", "stars": 3.7}, "Bloomfield": {"year": 2017, "text": "Was staying at a hotel and used yelp for delivery service. Delivery took a bit (I was worried because it was for a hotel), but it was delivered warm. It was a lot of food!  I had the chicken Katsu and it was good, the sauce was lumpy, I've never had lumpy sauce before, but it tasted fine. The minus star was because there was no soy sauce and chopsticks (-1/2 star) and the extended delivery time (-1/2 star).   I Would eat there/ order from there again. This is an updated review . They would not honor the Groupon even though they have honored it before. Unfortunately,  they didn't really explain well what the policy and why they changed the policy. \nVery disappointed at the communication for this coupon. \nWe ordered hibachi and some sushi.. since the sushi was not included. \n\nFood was good here and the service was decent. \nWe will prob not come back again as they do not honor the coupon even though we have used it before here. Weird environment , but the food was good! It took us a while for the hibachi dinner to get started, but otherwise the service was good. Seemed like there was only two waiters on a busy Friday night. Good selection of beer but only my second time in there and both times had extremely terrible customer service. I will not be going back to Liberty Beer and will take my service else where. Hopefully they will hire friendlier people in the near future. Very yummy! Have not eatin at the facility but I got a to go order and it was perfect! Also the owner and general manager where very welcoming and sweet! The bistro has a great family oriented feel. I cannot wait to go and have a sit down meal there!  I got tortellini verde and a Caesar salad. The Caesar salad is a vinaigrette which I enjoyed. They also have a delicious tiramisu! Since the remodel and reopening, the service and wait time have definitely gotten better. Sure, they're busy at lunch and dinner but that is to be expected. It looks so much nicer inside and the employees are friendlier. Super cute little spot. I always get fast and friendly service. The PB&J sushi is just too cute and also delicious. They even give you chopsticks! I haven't had anything from here that I didn't like, but it's also hard to jack up such a classic! First timers to this small bar/restaurant that has great options for vegetarians and carnivores alike! Today I tried the shells and cheese which was dynamite. My partner got the tofu shepard's pie that was out of this world. And my plate of choice was a classy and filling veggie burger! Two thumbs way up, not disappointed. Will return in the future! Ritter's might be one of the only true, old school diners left in Pittsburgh. And I absolutely adore it. I get the impression that most of the waitresses at Ritters have been employees for multiple decades, as well as most of the cooks. The food is classic hearty diner fare, the prices are low, and the ambiance is everything you could ask for, plus it's open 24 hours a day. Definitely worth a try. First time here. Had an upset stomach and wanted some plain toast and scrambled eggs and randomly hot chocolate? Who knows why. But came in and sat down at the bar around 930, immediately was waited on and had hot chocolate in front of me in 30 seconds. Ordered eggs toast and bacon at 934 and it was in front of me at 939 plus some classic breakfast potatoes for like $6. Awesome value. There was an angry guy a ways down the bar from me on the phone but it was more comedic than anything that he had the energy to be that angry in public so early in the day lol all in all great classic diner atmosphere and the waitress Heather was really nice. Solid Pittsburgh breakfast joint. Great diner !! 4am or 4 pm great food , workers are down to earth never bad service .. The main focus here seems to be the bar. I'm not a dri ker so that doesn't appeal to me. The food here isn't terrible but also not really something to write home about. Great place for excellent food and outstanding service.  Don't forget to save room for desert and time to have a conversation at the bar.  Recommend this place for a pleasurable experience. Lot 17 is my go-to place in Bloomfield for a good, reasonably-priced meal, a good and monthly-changing selection of draft beers, good service and overall good vibes. It's not uncommon for my wife and I to go here 3-4x a month and on multiple times we've brought friends and family along because we've consistently had good experiences here. \nThe staff is friendly and attentive and the food is consistently good. For a 9 dollars, I often get the buffalo chicken wrap and fries. My wife sometimes gets one of the other chicken wraps (which are also good) or gets a salad. They always have a special and the times that I was inclined to try it, I didn't leave disappointed either. Usually, on average, for two wraps and appetizer and a drink each, our bill is no more than 35 dollars.\nI think the best thing about Lot 17 is that it's family owned... the owners are always around and take an interest in ensuring their customers have a good experience. Came here for NYE with a few friends. It was super crowded but overall fun atmosphere. Met the GM who was fun and accommodating and we were able\nTo have a champagne toast at midnight! I'm not Local but it was a fun trip down to the burgh! Posting because a friends post got deleted (real smooth, yelp.) I have honestly never had a more uncomfortable bar experience than here. My friend and I went to see a band perform, but accidentally came an hour early. We figured we would order drinks but were still thinking about what we wanted, and the waitress was extremely outright rude and sarcastic with us. We were younger than the general demographic of bar \"regulars,\" but I'm tired of being treated like crap at bars like these despite the fact that I'm a 20-something. I have a good job and money I would love to spend at a nice bar with friendly staff and good beer and music-- unfortunately, this is not the place for that. Young people who want to be treated with respect, steer clear. I'm not a fan of the food here. I can't blame the place as I am just not a fan of this kind of food. Quick service, folks were friendly. Ordered the fresh spring rolls, they were the bomb! Followed that with the tofu vermicelli bowl and it was even better. Just the right amounts of everything and it was perfectly seasoned . Also tried the tofu fried rice and that was even better than the vermicelli bowl! Great flavor, big portion and left a happy camper. The best Vietnamese food in Pittsburgh! Lots of vegetables, chicken, noodle, etc. Wonderful flavors, lots of food & all at a reasonable price. Shame! Shame! Shame!  Have you ever eaten so much you just felt ashamed? That's what happened with that 1/2# burger.  Good Lawd(Lord)!  It was not only huge, it was seared and cooked nicely...medium. It was a 3-napkin burger. AND, I have never had broccoli with a side of clarified butter. Crazy man, but I dipped them little flowers in that like crab legs.\nThe legend of this place met my expectations. Thanks. Love this place. Always great food, service and atmosphere. Fantastic value. A favorite when I'm in the Bloomfield area. Best buffalo chicken pizza around, hands down. The boardwalk slices of regular pizza are absolutely fantastic! Service is always quick and have never had any issues here. The pizza and hoagies here are absolutely amazing. I do, however, recommend picking it up as delivery can sometimes take a bit long. Understandably so, the food is great! Great pizza for cheap! Nothing more you can ask for.\n\nThe owner is nice and friendly and the pizza is great. Their 2 slices and drink for 5.10 is a great deal. My favorite Thai spot in the city. I eat here regularly. Great staff, great food, great prices. I recommend their Chiang Mai Mee, Pad Kee Mao, or any of their curries. Their lemongrass soup is also unlike any place else, and you get a cup of it plus a spring roll with your lunch entree! The Thai iced tea is also great. Delicious! I have had this place under the radar for quite some time now since I have been pursuing tea houses. Located close to Children's hospital in Bloomfield this tiny bar serves a small selection of sandwiches and desserts but a good selection of teas. \n\nThey are all loose leaf and are available for purchase. I decided to opt for the \"rose hips\" fruity tea. The counterman was very friendly and put the tea in one of those tea cup holders and set a \"timer\" for me to let it steep 3 minutes. Nice idea for when I brew my own! He told me that my tea would be enough for a complimentary refill but I only had enough time for one cup.\n\nThe place is laid out nicely and free in house WiFi is available. My tea was very good and flavorful. It was perfect for a bitterly cold winter's day. They do offer a nice selection of black, green, and decaffeinated teas as well. Pay street parking is available. Most definitely will return to check out some of their other teas in the future. Breakfast is good but the service is a little lacking in the friendly area. Server and cook were both iffy with their attitudes.. it almost seemed as if neither wanted to be there. Wanted to check out this new place in Bloomfield, and what has been done post Del's. The inside definitely switched around where the bar used to be located on the left if you are standing in front, and the dining to the right which is now reversed. Overall, they did a nice job on the place inside. Now for the good stuff...or not so good stuff...\n\nMy partner and I went in Saturday night around 9 PM and sat at the bar, and were greeted by someone friendly when we went in. It was maybe five minutes until we were greeted by one bartender, and since we were not ready that bar tender disappeared and then were greeted by a female bartender who was much more attentive, warm, and friendly who got us our drinks. The bar had cleared out by 9:15. I ordered the house margarita which was fairly priced and my partner ordered a beer. We had another friend meeting us, but felt very pressured by the male bartender to put in an order for drinks and food, he was not so warm and smooth.. maybe his shift was ending and he wanted to get out of there ASAP? \n\nSo, our friend met us, and then we decided on three things: \nAPPETIZER: Cajun Fries served w/  Cajun dipping sauce\nDINNERS: 1/2 rack of ribs with fries & mac n cheese  + smoked half chicken with sweet potato and broccoli. \nAs our dinners were coming out the appetizer was nowhere to be found and hadn't come out, but wait... it was coming out behind the dinners. \n\nSmoked Chicken: very greasy, as if it was smoked then dropped in a deep fryer, but the technique completely failed and the amount of oil and grease made me sick. The broccoli tasted like MEAT, it literally tasted like it was steamed or cooked, or stored with meat, I couldn't even eat it. Sweet potato, well you can't mess up a sweet potato really. \n\nRibs : not such a good quality of meat, and the mac n cheese was not too good either. The sauce was served on the side, but the bartender did not really educate us on the sauces or what there specialty was, recommended etc.\n\nCajun Fries: Just frozen fries, with some cajun seasoning on them, and an attempt at cajun aioli. The cajun fries were the only good thing that we received food wise. \n\nOverall, I agree with DJ J. who left a review on 1/5/17 that said how interesting it is with 5 Star reviews; Has anyone else been to all of the OTHER amazing restaurants in Pittsburgh vs. Jabos ?   I was not impressed by any of means, no WOW factor here, folks.  With all of the amazing food, trendy restaurants, and creative ideas Pittsburgh offers, this place has a lot of work ahead. As far as the service, Jabo's definitely landed for the most part good people, but their overall operations needs some work, and the food is nothing I would ever drop money on again with Tessaro's right down Liberty, Shadyside five minutes away, and Lawrenceville not far either. The couple next to us ordered, the bartenders and staff apologized because they ordered salads and it had been sometime since they came out, the dressings were missing , etc. I would say give Jabo's the benefit of the doubt since they just opened, but these are restaurant basics 101 they are missing the swing on.\n\n Would maybe stop in for drinks ,but will not short myself of great food the Steel City has to offer again on Saturday night here.Good luck to others who try it out , maybe your experience and food will be worth it. Haven't even received my meal yet and I'm writing a review.\n\nJill is our server, she's upbeat and amazing.\n\nAppetizers.. wings, pulled pork nachos, and bacon. Yes.. bacon. The wings were perfectly crispy and their dry rub is fantastic. The pulled pork on the nachoes melted in our mouths and was seasoned perfectly. The tortilla chips were crispy not soggy, bonus! The bacon.. what else can I say? It's bacon.. yes, you heard me! smokey.. delicious.. bacon. \n\nSoups.. chili and chicken tortilla soup. There was no shortage of meat in this chili. Seasoned perfectly and filling! The chicken tortilla soup wasn't a favorite but everything can't be a win. Generous with the chicken but the broth wasn't spectacular.\n\nSides.. Cornbread and Mac n Cheese. Cornbread.. I loved it! Smothered it in butter and dipped it in my chili.. To. Die. For. However, the mac n cheese lacked in flavor, texture, and color. It tasted watered down and had next to no cheese flavor. (This was taken care of on our bill.)\n\nEntrees.. Bloomfield brisket, half rack of ribs, Cajun burger, and another burger I forget the name of. Bloomfield brisket has onions and peppers with melted provolone, I chose to have it on an onion roll. Brisket was succulent. The ribs came out completely overdone, also taken care of on the bill. Both burgers were cooked as preferred and the meat was seasoned perfectly. Juicy and excellent portion size. \n\nIf 3.5 stars was an option, I would have given that as opposed to the 4. Had lunch at Jabo's on a snowy Saturday afternoon. The decor is decent, the food was decent and the service was a little better than decent. Beer selection, though good for a pittsburgh restaurant say 15 years ago was pretty much par for the course. Not over inspired but certain that you can find a something reasonable to drink. Disappointed to not find a single stout or porter on tap despite it being the dead of winter. Only Guinness by the bottle. There is better smoked meat available in Lawrenceville so i will not likely go out of my way to return unless my other standards are closed. I wish them luck. I am sure if i lived in the neighborhood and could walk that i would visit it again. Certainly a good addition to Bloomfield but not a destination spot. Food/drinks are good, if you are lucky enough to have the service to deliver it. 3 people behind the bar standing around & we can't get a drink. Servers seem to be overextended - out of breathe when delivering our meal after an hour of waiting, while the bartender refuses to take our drink order while the server runs around trying to attend to everyone on the floor.\nAdjustments need to be made or this is just another Dels. Best dry rub smoked wings I have had! This restaurant is extremely clean and recently updated, very nice atmosphere and the staff are awesome! It's a weight loss miracle!  After me and my friend ate the combo platter, we both have lost about 10 lbs over the next 24 hours!!!!  I can't believe how thin and svelt I'm looking these days. I've been looking to finally purge all that toxic sludge in my bowels that I keep hearing about and wow, what a difference. So you spend all New Year's Eve and day in a bathroom? What would you care, as long as you finally get that flat stomach all your friend have pained over in the gym the last few months. We can't thank Jabo's enough for our new physique. BACON!!!!\n are you kidding me!?!????!!!\nOutrageous/ I will be dreaming about this bacon!\nBrisket, chicken, ribs all delectable \nTried Coleslaw- very mayonnaisey , sweet potato, mac and cheese,  all good.\nFriendly attentive staff. I have been to Jabos twice now.  I was very impressed with their wait staff, since they had only been open for a week.  They were very attentive and served drinks and food in record time!  Good value for what you get and the food was very good.  Went there for New Years Eve with 12 people.  Usually a restaurant has problems with serving the food hot with such a large group.  This did not happen at Jabos.  The service was spot on and the food was delicious and hot!!  I would highly recommend Jabos to anyone that likes good food and a fun and friendly environment!! So happy to have this place near by! I was bummed when the Del's location was vacant for so long but happy to hold out for this place! \n\nFirst of all the inside is great. Totally different than Del's with a beautiful tin roof, cool lighting, a nice long bar and two dining rooms for a variety of different \"atmospheres\" in the same place. \n\nThe bar has lots of options and beer prices are reasonable. The menu is extensive with so many things I want to try. \n\nMy sister had the pulled chicken quesadilla and it was awesome. I had the smoque stack sandwich and it was REALLY good. The brisket had a great flavor and was really tender and the bacon on it was thick and juicy (sometimes bacon that is added on to a sandwich gets neglected). I had the sandwich on the onion roll which is also really good. For the side I had the mac and cheese. The sauce was flavorful with a hint of pepper jack. It could have been warmer but I think they are still working out some kinks, and I'm much more picky about food temp than most people. \n\nMy boyfriend had the combo platter with ribs, chicken and brisket with potato salad and cornbread. We liked that they gave you a choice of white or dark chicken meat. Everything was well seasoned and tasty and it was a huge amount of food for the price. The potato salad wasn't the greatest -- a little too much mayo, but the cornbread was probably the best I've ever had. \n\nService was excellent as well. We will be regulars! Yummy food - love how they redid the inside of the place - called ahead & good was ready right in time. Very friendly staff - definitely will be back Just had a \"quick lunch\" at Jabo's today.  DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!\n \nWe stood at the door for 10+ minutes waiting to be seated.  Then a bar patron said to go sit down and he'd tell the bartender.  5 more minutes before a waitress came....\n \n1. the SWEET TEA was like licking a sugar cube - impossible to even drink it was way too sweet, but I guess that's personal opinion.  It made McDonald's sweet tea seem like water.\n\n2. Our water glass had lipstick on it.  gag.\n\n3. Another friend's salad was a $6 pile of the white stalk part of the lettuce and 1 wedge of tomato.  We did finally ask the waitress if we could speak to a manager.  The waitress said this was a side salad so instead of $6, charged her 2.99.  I still think a restaurant shouldn't give out the white part of lettuce in a salad. \n\n4. my chicken sandwich tasted so smoky I pretty much just ate a campfire.  I guess that's just personal opinion.\n\nIt was a let down.  The waitress was training a new waiter.  The trainee was very nice & efficient. Stopped in to meet a friend.  \n\nWas interesting in trying with so many 5 Star Reviews from many with only 1 review, knew many of the reviews must be experts. Ha!\n\nWe sat in the bar area that has 3 TV's over the bar and a TV beside the door for a table in the window.  Our server was good but seemed to always have to ask everyone a question when inputing the order in the system so there was some loud asking about type of sauce or bun or whatever across the bar and room. Must be a new wait person that hasn't figured out what is needed to complete the order when asking at the table.\n\nThere are about 20 beers on tap and pricing was good.  Ordered The Jabo which is Brisket topped with homemade macaroni and cheese and Jabo's signature BBQ sauce, on a fresh baked roll with a pickle spear and one side.  The sandwich was interesting. My brisket was mostly cold, thought it should be warmer and did not have much of the smoke BBQ flavor I expected.  The mac & cheese was OK, prefer it to be sharper cheese.  My side of baked beans was good and spicy.  As for the pickle spear..it did not appear and I just decided not to ask.  Looks like Jabo's has some service issues to work out but since they just recently opened will have to give them the benefit of being new. Was very excited to try this place out as I had heard good things, sadly they turned out to either not be true or we came on a very off night. I will say the wings and bacon for the appetizers were very good but once we got to the entrees it went very downhill both from a food and service standpoint. I ordered the beef brisket sandwich and it came out cold around most of the sandwich besides a lukewarm center and was very dry. My dad ordered the brisket dinner and it was very dry and cold as well. My girlfriend ordered a combo platter and had the same issue with the brisket and had a curly black hair underneath her chicken breast. We alerted our waitress to the issues and she was very apologetic and promised to get it right. While we were waiting for her to take care of the issues a gentleman who identified himself as one of the owners came over. We told him about the issues and he offered replacements but said that the brisket is cooked, sliced and put into a steam tray and would most likely be no hotter or less dry. My dad decided to go for the ribs instead, I asked for a replacement sandwich but for the brisket to be heated up before being put in the bun, my girlfriend was grossed out by the hair and decided to skip eating. The owner then popped up a few minutes later with a bald gentleman and said \"hey guys I found the guy who's hair was in your food haha\" and walked away which we all found to be extremely unprofessional and definitely not a good thing to do when you're in the process of rectifying a situation after multiple mistakes. The owner then came back a few minutes later with my dad's ribs and I asked when my brisket would be coming out. He said that he didn't think I wanted it anymore so he didn't put in another order and that he went back and checked my prior sandwich by putting his finger into the center of it and that it was \"warm enough\" and became argumentative. I told him I had no wish to argue with him and would just go hungry and have him remove it from our check instead. At no time during any of our interactions with the owner did he offer and sort of apology to us for the issues we had. For the owner of a restaurant to become combative with a customer who had an issue seemed like something out of kitchen nightmares. Extremely sad to see that this business was not what we hoped for, I hope they are able to fix their issues and improve the way they interact with their customers. The chili cheese dogs are fantastic, the chili truly is the star of the show! The hand-cut fries are seasoned perfectly and will absolutely haunt you in your dreams.. seriously, they're that delicious! Awesome lunch stand.  I ordered tacos--they were super-inexpensive and tasty.  Service was fast.  They took over from Roz...did a great job.  Highly recommend. The quick review is - pleasantly surprised, but bring a stack o' cash or leave your appetite at home. And now for the how. The ambiance you're presented with is a sleek mix of low lighting, tables, bar seats, bar height tables, and an exposed kitchen. Read and re-read the tap list, but it was tough to find a beer that grabbed our attention that evening (there is a worthy wine list though). Reading the food menu is of equal experience - nothing that really stood out other than elevated ingredient pairings with price points to match. The 'bites' take the word bite quite literally and an array of them would be necessary to feel $atiated. So the haters and the doubters are in full effect...then, pleasantly surprised once you take that first bite! The scallop + butternut ravioli plate layered complimentary flavors including prosciutto and pesto. The mussels with its spicy tomato based broth and chorizo bits were also a hit as were the arancini, which were unexpectedly excellent.  Further, the meatballs were good not great.  It's obvious that the dishes are prepared with precision, and their presentation is to be lauded.  A future visit will have to include a fresh pasta and/or a more adventurous 'composed' plate off their ephemeral menu...oh and a proper cocktail! Fresh and amazing subs famous for the Cheesesteak but the Italian and chicken Philly are also my favs. I get angry at myself for going to other places because they've been very dissapointing over and over. I just wish Penn Station had cheese sauce for their fresh cut fries. Although the portions aren't tremendous, the ingredients are top shelf. Genuine home cooked, quality meals. The shrimp scampi is phenomenal, the best I've had in a while. Great place. I highly recommend. The sevice came with a smile here. The server was incredibly friendly and made suggestions off of the menu as I had not been here before. On Wednesday, I ordered 4 rolls from then 10 mins before closing but they still made it really good and not even complained about I ordered it so late. Gun a is one of my favorite sushi places. This place is sketchy from the moment that you approach the entrance. Even looking in through the window should have been hint enough not to go in there. We came here for the last day of restaurant week. It wasn't our first choice; OMG I'm so glad the other place wouldn't take our reservation!  We loved everything about Sausalido!  It's a small, warn little restaurant with maybe 15 - 20 tables. As others have noted, it's BYOB, with a $2/person corkage fee. The menu is quite small, but it's still difficult to decide because everything, literally everything, sounds fabulous. Our waiter was perfect, attentive and friendly without being obtrusive. I ordered the restaurant week Prix fixe meal, which, sadly, wasn't actually on the regular menu. From start to end, it was amazing. After the appetizer, I told my girlfriend that Sausalido was going into our rotation, and by the end of the meal, she agreed that it would be a priority restaurant for us from now on. If you should go when they have it, the paella is the best I've ever eaten, and the side salad with shaved brussels sprouts and feta was really amazing. Portions are large enough to fill me up and for my girlfriend to bring some home. There's parking on Liberty Street, or a municipal parking lot behind the restaurant, I think I'm the same block. Go to Sausalido! It could not have been more fantastic. This place is excellent.  I came here for dinner last week with a large group of friends. We basically ordered 2 of everything on the menu.  Everything was good but the highlights were (1) the mushroom pierogis; (2) the pumpkin and fennel seed soup; and (3) the oyster mushrooms with cabbage.  The cocktails are also excellent! (I had two frenets and scotch).\n\nMy only real critique is that all of the dishes came out at once which was a little overwhelming.  I would have liked the waiter to tell us to stagger our order so that things came out in courses.  Otherwise this place is perfect! I love settling in at a restaurant for a nice meal, but sometimes I want awesome food (and Apteka's dishes with brilliant flavors are certainly that) but I'm short on time. Many people have kids, after-work commitments, a dog in the car, whatever, but still want delicious vegan food, in a city that doesn't have a ton of vegan options.\n\nAt most restaurants, there's a thing called \"take out\" - novel concept, I know - where you can call ahead and pick up your order. Apteka disallows this. You can place a takeout order, but only if you're physically present at Apteka. Which means you're waiting around the restaurant while they prepare your meal. Worse, they're absolute jerks about it.\n\nSure, some upscale restaurants don't do takeout orders. But Apteka isn't that. It's a bunch of hipsters (I say that lovingly because I probably am one) standing around in torn-up hoodies.\n\nI liked the food, for sure, but the snippy staff and unwelcoming policies have to go. This is exactly why non-vegans hate trying vegan places. Incredible pierogies! Very chill, hip vegan place. Can't wait to continue to go back until I've tried everything on the menu. Very cool bar area as well for drinks or to sit at and dine. Apteka is a unique restaurant featuring Eastern European vegan cuisine. As a carnivore, I can assure anyone with taste for good food, that they're culinary desires will  be satisfied. Despite the description of the cuisine, which might seem limiting -- there's actually a decent size menu that offers a variety of tastes and options that range from light to very filling. Remember that vegan doesn't mean gluten-free, so there's plenty of carbs available from dumplings in a delicious carrot broth (Kluski Slaskie) to pierogies with fun fillings to veggie sandwiches on rich bread. As a bonus, this casual and comfortable yet hip eatery is open late nights with a more limited, but still delicious menu. There's a full bar with some clever cocktails, craft beers and a small selection of interesting wines. Service is simple with ordering done at the counter just inside the front door, take your carafe of water and order number, choose a table and it won't be long before your picture perfect food arrives. Customer sitting at the bar can have an open tab, thus replicating full table service. The staff appears to be young and ambitious, taking pride in their craft. I am the literal definition of a carnivore, the kind that orders an extra steak or lambchop for dessert. Vegan or not, the meal I had last Friday was nothing short of amazing. The tartines were varied and savoury, the pierogi prepared two ways also distinct and worth going back for another plate of soon. Give it a shot, have a couple excellent cocktails and enjoy a well prepared meal in a fun space with some friends I am in love with this place.  Awesome to see such a unique, tasty, and gourmet vegan spot in town.  Loved the Baba Jaga sandwich, tartines, and of course the perogies. Cocktails are great, too. Super\ncool vibe and looking forward the outside space in the warm weather. I had to order a dinner for about 15 physicians to be delivered between 5-515p.  While Thai Cuisine is closed between 2:30-5, their service was impeccable.  \n\nI called Thai Cuisine around 11:30 am to figure out if/how they could do our order.  I wanted to see if they could even have our food at 5.  The gentleman I spoke with was awesome.  Let me know that while they didn't deliver, grub hub did.  He also let me know  - they could take our order over the phone so they could start - or I could submit it on grubhub with the 5p delivery request.\n\nI asked which was easier for them as I truly did appreciate all their help.  THe order was placed via grubhub. ( I will tell you the grubhub part of the experience was terrible (delivery driver in the lobby of the hospital saying rude things about other races, phone didn't work and said our delivery was delivered 10 minutes before we received it).  But this isn't a review on grubhub!)\n\nThai Cuisine beautifully labeled very container so I knew who got what food.  They sent forks, plates, extra sauce and chopsticks.  Everything was perfect. I couldn't have asked for an easier order.  \n\nEvery.single.physician raved about their food.  Every drop was eaten.  It was delicious!  Not a single complaint.  I don't have any eating in the restaurant experience, but to go orders are amazing and will certainly happen again!  Thank you Thai Cuisine for being so helpful and accomodating! The service here is alla fast and friendly. Every time I come here, they are bisy but never miss a beat. The food comes out fast and without interruption. The breakfast sandwiches and the potato salad really shine! I believe that most of the people who rated this Restaurant below 4 or 5 stars just didn't understand what this Restaurant was. Someone below commented that the price point was too high because similar products were being offered for a lower price elsewhere. For that person, I say this: You're wrong. There is now and never was anyone in the city of Pittsburgh doing what was happening at that bakery. No one else has gone to effort of sourcing the best possible ingredients to create the highest quality product possible. Whether it was the perfect tomato from a neighborhood backyard, olive oil specially imported from a small company in italy, or the various local PA wheats that were trialed,  Bread & Salt never compromised. No one else would be able to successfully ferment a sourdough loaf(no yeast) for 72 hours at 90% hydration to create a loaf with a beautiful hard crust and delicate custard-like center. No one could coax the best possible flavor out of their ingredients with at times little more than vinegar and salt. Knowing the story helps, but if you couldn't put this food in your mouth and understand why it was so much better than anything else Pittsburgh ever offered, it just wasn't for you. This is probably the best bang for your buck, Chinese takeout wise in the area. The service is super fast and they are pretty friendly. The shrimp eggrolls are amazing. The general tso extra spicy is pretty good too! Amazing taste!!!!!!! My fav Chinese restaurant in pittsburgh.\nWe called to order sesonal chicken with fried rice and wonton soup.\nI love it! Even more than pf chang We've been meaning to get to Station for some time, so I joined my wife and her friend as a third wheel on a Friday night. Reservations were easy enough and the restaurant was full for the entire evening. I wasn't exactly sure how to describe their menu... gastropub? Italian? Not quite sure.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised with their affordable list of wines and tried both the Cabernet and Malbec, both of which I enjoyed. Pretty standard list of cocktails with a focus on bourbon from what I could tell, and a list of 8-10 drafts.\n\nWe decided to start with the chicken wings which were some of the most unique ones I've had in Pittsburgh and came from chickens on steroids from what I could tell (they were big, not implying anything else). Crispy/spicy and covered with an oil, cream, and pickled peppers.\n\nFor dinner I had a pasta dish with pork (which was ham, was expecting a different preparation but was gladly surprised) and a one hour egg. I had a hard time ordering, but this dish was a pleasant surprise.\n\nWe split the two desserts on the menu including the caramel corn panna cotta which was fine enough, and the lavender pound cake. Not overly aromatic, and a unique combination, but not my favorite by any means.\n\nOverall an enjoyable experience! Creative, fresh, unique food, the best bottle of Malbec I've ever had and attentive service prevails over absurdly long wait times and a meal that lasts almost 4 hours: \nI'll start with the good. The food is phenomenal. For me, the best part is that the menu is filled with items that I would never make at home, and probably couldn't even if I tried. Went as a first timer during restaurant week so I was able to sample a salad, main course and dessert. I went with the roasted carrot salad, as did my friend sitting next to me, and we agreed it was pretty gosh darn delicious. My favorite part was the chickpea fritters, which served as a sort of fried doughy crouton. Yum. For the main course I went for the Dill Rigatoni and let me tell you, I almost licked my plate clean. I'm so not used to these flavors with pasta but everything worked together beautifully. I especially loved how, for a pasta dish, it still felt like a light, airy meal. No complaints other than I usually like my pasta cooked a little more al dente but that's hardly even worth mentioning considering how great everything else was. Dessert was the caramel popcorn panna cotta. Served in a mason jar this dessert is probably one of the more adorable things I've consumed. Topped with salty Carmel corn the whole thing was melt-in-your-mouth amazing. Washed this whole meal down with an incredible bottle of Malbec (priced fairly at $36... we got three) and I can say this meal was truly top notch. Note: Friends also raved over the chicken liver mousse, corned beef tongue on toast, and crispy wings. Highly recommend all three. \nThe not so good: Went with a group of 8 during restaurant week. I know what you're thinking but in fairness the place was not overly crowded and I don't think we made any outlandish requests during our stay. Our waiter, when we saw her, was attentive but the problem was that we waited up to an hour for requests and orders. After a round of drinks we put in salads and appetizers, those took an hour. In between courses when we wanted drink refreshes, it seemed to take forever. It even got to the point where we felt like we had to order another drink when our current one was half full. The whole meal took almost four hours and while I love sitting around a table with my friends enjoying a nice long meal, this felt a little more like our party had been tossed aside. Going back to the waiter, she was nice enough to comp a drink that took especially long and split up our bills with extreme precision. She was fun to talk to and super nice. I think the wait time issues may have been coming from behind the scenes. But really, no way to tell. On top of it all, the whole wait time situation was never really addressed. Nothing like \"hey sorry guys XYZ is taking a bit, we'll have it right out\" or anything like that. Eventually when everything was finished up, we walked out in grumbly frustration rather than riding high from an exceptional meal, which is sad considering everyone really really loved the food and drinks. \nTo end on a high note: the only reason this place didn't get my five-star rating is because of how long everything took. The atmosphere is awesome, the place draws a really cool crowd and serves amazing cuisine. I would happily go back, but maybe without any after-dinner plans in case it ran long again. I finally got a chance to try this place and it is one of my favorite of the new Pittsburgh restaurants this year.  I love the cozy atmosphere and ambiance that is made to look like an old train station, with nice details like the tin roof.  The menu has some interesting options and it was hard to make a decision.  We started with the wings which we shared, and they were so juicy and full of flavor let crunch on the outside--some of the best wings I've ever had.  For my entree I had a pasta dish, the Tagliattelle, which was amazing. You could tell that all the ingredients were very fresh, the pasta was homemade, and the egg on top was perfectly cooked. In addition to some of the fancier entrees they also have a nice range of regular bar food like burgers and sandwiches. All of their portions were generous and I felt the prices were reasonable for the amount and quality of the food.  They also have a decent beer draft list and a nice cocktail menu.  I tried one of their cocktails which was excellent. Their brunch menu also looks really good and I want to go back there sometime to try it. This is a great addition to the Bloomfield neighborhood. I came here for brunch with 2 of my lady friends, the third was unable to make it :-(. We wanted to booze, brunch, and bitch, as we do.\nWe started with 2 bloody marys, and a michaleda. Their bloody marys are SPICY but not overly so, they're rimmed with some smokey spices, they come with a pickled pepper and a pickled beet (?). Both of which I ate. I'm a sucker for briny things. I love their bloody's. They're perfect. I tried the michaleda and really enjoyed it too. I followed up with a margarita. It was very good, not the best I've ever had but I'm really picky about my margaritas. \nI ordered their steak and eggs. The steak was cooked perfectly. The \"bbq tots\" were incredible. I could seriously eat about 20 of them! The bearnaise sauce was really good, very creamy. I'm weird about eggs, I really truly am. These eggs were over easy (or as you 'burghers call it \"dippy\"). The bread that came with my meal was perfect for dipping and sopping up the warm yolky mess I managed to make.  I would definitely go back, and I quite look forward to having dinner there. I can only imagine it is equally as delish! It's a bit pricey, but I never really mind spending the money when the portions and the food is as perfectly balanced as their was! Interesting dishes! Reading the menu the items seemed bizarre, but actual meal was delicious. Good blend of flavors and hearty food. Groceria Italiana is a hidden gem off of Liberty Avenue in Bloomfield. They have a small deli with italian style meats and delicious cheese, they have salads and ready to eat hot food as well and they have tons of sauces, breads and pastas. Although I have not tried all of their goodies yet, I am pretty obsessed with their homemade ravioli. I have tried the imported cheese and the traditional cheese and both are delicious. Just follow the instructions on the outside of the box and you're set. They are totally affordable for the quality you are receiving. They also have homemade lasagna, homemade meatballs, homemade meatballs and desserts. YUM. Cute little hidden gem in the heart of Bloomfield. If you aren't paying attention, you will just about miss it as I almost did. They have the best fried dough I've ever had!", "stars": 3.9}, "Bon Air": {"year": 2016, "text": "Lunch is 12 bucks all you can eat plus free hibachi can't beat it food is decent definitely better than the one at century square Chinese/Japanese food. Overall not bad quality for a buffet. A lot better than the buffets I am used to. Overall not bad quality. \n\nSushi was OK. Pretty good for a buffet sushi.  \n\nIf you are going for crab leg, be sure to ask if there is none out.  They are happy to get some out as soon as possible. \n\nConsidering it is a buffet, 4 stars is fair.  If it was a regular service place, I'd have to go with a 3 star. \n\n $14.99 for Sunday buffet, includes crab legs. Ate there twice food was average if you dont feel like cooking its the place to be..I like the fried shrimp..mussels.. crab ragoon too..and not to mention sushi is decent...veggies are good...damn it its all good Eww. Don't do it. \nThe quality of the food is poor. Each selection that we made from the buffet was either cold or overcooked and dry from sitting out for a long time. \nThe cleanliness of the restaurant is very poor and the facilities are poor and in disrepair. The tables are sticky and the booths have huge holes in them. The floor is filthy and there is a foul odor in the entire restaurant. \nI was with my 10 year old daughter and was charged for 2 adult meals. When I mentioned this to the waitress, she said she'd fix it. Who I assume was the owner came over to the table and quite loudly said that my daughter was too tall and wanted her to stand up beside the table so that he could measure her and if she was over 5 ft tall he would charge her full price. She was mortified. I informed him that this was extremely rude and that he was not going to be measuring anybody. After arguing with me for a few minutes and causing a scene in the middle of the dining area, he reluctantly agreed to charge the appropriate price for a child. However, his rude behavior combined with the poor quality of food, and filthy conditions left me with a literal bad taste in my mouth. \nI will never return to this dump and I expect it will be shut down soon. Solid buffet. Great selection, good quality food, lots of seafood options, hibachi, and very tolerable sushi. For a buffet. This is a good location, and the food is what you'd expect from an average American Chinese buffet, but the staff is very nice even though they don't speak much English they will try their best to make sure your satisfied. They listen to your requests and try their best to make it happen. They're takeout is pretty cheap too. \n\nThey have a lot of space too so that's a plus you don't feel crowded or rushed. Also there is lots of free parking they have a huge parking lot so its not like places you feel like you have to worry about parking or ticketing (big problem in the burgh btw)\n\nThe coconut shrimp is really good! And the fruit is very fresh! Despite the Italian decor leftover from the previous business,  this place is great. Sushi selection is extensive, Mongolian bar is good, and selection is decent. The service is always friendly and attentive. If you're thinking about dining here, you might want to think again. The place is huge and there is a wide variety of dishes but none were very good. I had the worst California roll I've ever eaten. The food was either too bland, overcooked, or had too much fish sauce. The only food we did like was that which was purchased by the restaurant (ice cream, cake, cookies).\n\nWe went on a Saturday night at 7, but there were very few people there. Of course with all the different rooms it was hard to tell. The place used to be an Italian restaurant and none of the decor has been changed, including the pictures on the walls. The large booths have crumbling vinyl and the place smells like a nursing home with a fish market next door.\n\nFor $15 a person and really expensive drinks its not worth it, unless you're really strapped for time and don't care what you eat. Needless to say, I will not be returning. For a $8.55 (with tax) all you can eat chinese lunch buffet, your expectations have to be pretty low. That being said, for the price, its solid. Food is mediocre (at best) but nothing stood out as unedible. Some things could've been heated up a little more. Id recommend only going for lunch because not only is dinner more, the food tends to be more cold and soggy. The restroom, however, was one of the worst public restrooms iv ever stepped foot in to. The lights way too dim, all urinals backed up, urine on the floor, toilet seats filthy. Sorry for ruining your appetite =p I am in love with the all you can eat sushi bar here. I can't complain about this place, I'm here quite often. Probably more than I should be, but the Sushi call me in. Never trust a sushi buffet where the rice has enough time to get hard. My wife and I ate there,  every thing was cold. I had to ask for a crab cracker for the cold crab legs and if you're going to serve meat a knife would be nice. To top it all off the waitress grabbed the paid check to look for a tip and gave us a disgusted look before we even got up from the table will never go there again. I really did not like this place. Though the prices are low, in my opinion, it is not worth it. As other reviewers have stated, the food was not heated as thoroughly as it should have been. Everything I had was average at best, and I don't remember anything sticking out or leaving me thinking to myself that I had to get more. What I disliked the most, however, was the service. All the staff I encountered was unfriendly. Waitstaff was inattentive and barely came to check on my table. The worst part was when a waitress presented the check, she pointed to the bottom and said, \"here is suggested tip amount\". I felt that was rude and unprofessional. I will not be coming back here. Don't let the name fool you, this is a \"Chinese style buffet\" inside an old Italian restaurant, but looks Spanish?! Pretty popular from my perspective, popped in on a Sunday afternoon, the lot looked full but the restaurant is so huge, it seemed empty. It's smaller (less offerings) than most all you can eat Chinese buffets. \n\nWe were seated pretty far from the buffet, which can be a good thing, or not. Fellow YELPER Kevin C. joined me for dinner, heading to the buffet is where we parted ways. I headed straight to the sushi station and filled a platter with tempting offerings and a bowl of seaweed salad. Kevin found all his favorites, including Crab Rangoon and dumplings. \n\nFor sushi lovers there isn't a lot of choices, but for 16 bucks you can get your sushi fix and fill up nicely. I had a huge bowl of healthy seaweed salad that I've paid 8.95 for at Yokoso! They did have salmon, red snapper, yellow fin, and sea bass, vegan rolls and crab rolls. As I said, not a lot of choices but the Sushi chef if right there making them as fast as they go. I wasn't expecting much, but was pleasantly surprised by the freshness. \n\nI did look around and found they had all the normal offerings found on Chinese buffets, General Tso's, sweet n sour, fried rice, noodles, green beans etc. \n\nThe building used to be Tambellini's, a old name associated with the Pittsburgh restaurant scene. It looks like it could use some spiffing up as I noticed broken light fixtures, burned out bulbs in chandeliers, and outside, cracked siding and pieces of the roof laying in the parking lot. \n\nI'd say bypass this place and hit up some of the better buffets the city has to offer. Hokkaido on Brown's Hill Road comes to mind! Food was cold. Some things were undercooked. Some things were WAY overcooked. The pineapple chicken was like chewing on a stick of beef jerky. My jaw got sore chewing... I would not feed this to my dogs and they eat their own shit. To top that off they are EXTREMELY over priced for the quality of food, not top mention the lack of English speaking personnel that couldn't understand basic words and just stare at you when you ask for something. \n\nNever going back. Definitely one of the better Chinese buffets I've been to in Pittsburgh. Aside from the fact that they do not keep some of their items heated well enough, the food quality overall was not bad for a Chinese buffet. \n\nI was happy with the wide variety of food and sushi available for lunch. There were 2 vegetarian rolls (avocado & cucumber and tofu skin) which were pretty good. For vegetarians, there were several mixed vegetable dishes which is surprisingly rare to find in other buffets. Sadly, like every other buffet, there was no tofu entree option :( The dessert selection was decent but not as good as Hokkaido's. \n\nOverall, I was pleased with my experience. It's a great deal for an $8.99 lunch buffet. The selection was good, quality of food was decent, and the wait staff were friendly and quick to remove our dirty plates. I would definitely recommend it! It is sad to see what was once Louis Tambellini's magnificent, enormous restaurant now as a Chinese buffet, but time marches on.\n\nThe restaurant remains attractive and comfortable, room after room of tables.  \n\nI do not see any evidence that there is a manager or owner that a customer could ever get to know as the place is rather impersonal.  One server of mine was sullen; one was pleasant.\n\nThere is a tremendous selection of items, including sushi, hibachi, appetizers, salads, soups, entrees, good fried mushrooms and zucchini, fresh strawberries and pineapple.  The fresh fruit was a nice treat, but not as sweet or tasty as that which is served at similar restaurants.  I was afraid to try the \"Italian meat ball\" at a Chinese restaurant!\n\nThere is a sign addressing our \"value customer\": I suppose you could call us that!\n\nIt was disappointing that the only tofu was a container of small pieces of it to be added to soup.  The mixed vegetable dish contained no tofu.\n\nThe price of $8.99 for Saturday is quite reasonable, but not by comparison with Grand China in Bridgeville and Washington, Pennsylvania, which is $6.99, sometimes less with discount coupons that are received by mail.  Grand China offers the same types of dishes and stations that Yu's does and I like its food better.\n\nThere is something for everyone here, but I would not go out of the way to return. Very poor quality of food! Their food are always super dry. This would be my 4th time here, always giving them a another chance because it was so convenient. My husband, a friend, and I wanted something to eat real\nQuick before dropping my friend off tonight. So we decided to eat here because it was close by. Picture are deceiving. If you go early when they first open, it probably look like that but we were there at 7 and it doesn't close till 10..the food were super dry and they weren't refilling the food. I know it's only $14 a person but I'd rather pay an extra $5 and go to Hokkaido by the waterfront. Felt sick and really regret wasting my appetite here.

Despite the terrible pasta (still terrible) and horrible delivery, I started ordering again. And what do you know! Delivery improved tremendously!\n\nI moved, so I was now in their delivery radius as reported to GrubHub and could order directly from that website. (I still don't know what was going on that I could order on their restaurant website since I was within their service radius, but not grubhub before. Hrm.) I don't know if the website was the issue or they hired different delivery people or use GrubHub for delivery (I think through postmates or the like?) but however it works, it's much better now.\n\nI have now had the pizza and I'm very pleased with it. SO GOOD. I usually order either a cheese pizza w bacon and red peppers or I'll get their Hawaiian pizza. THEY HAVE MANGO ON IT. This is big for me. Pineapple, mango, bacon, and ham (which I subbed out for salami.) The mango adds a lot to the flavor, but I wish the chunks were bigger. That's my only complaint about the pizza. The crust isn't as thin as I would usually prefer, but its still yummy.\n\nThe cigar rolls are still perfect (when they have them) and the pasta is still overloaded with way, way too much of whatever sauce it's made with so I'm definitely going to stop ordering that from here. Most recently I ordered the creamy calabrese and couldn't eat more than two bites. It was overloaded with alfredo sauce and topped with a thick layer of cheese. It seems Angelina's approach to pasta is just to overload it with fat, which they've proven can actually be overdone. I threw out the pasta.\n\nBut for pizza, burgers, apps? If this much improved delivery continues, I will continue to make this my pizza go-to. Got delivery today, midafternoon and it was fast and hot. Prices seemed a bit high but portions were huge! Hummus is nice, light and creamy but a bit bland. Sleek! Always happy to find you on a menu.  Portion was overwhelming. Topped with yummy carmelized onions.  First bite an odd flavor I was not sure I liked but I could not stop eating it! The only drawback were the french fries, crispy and hot but had a coating on them from a frozed package and were a bit too greasy. After finding Jolina's on GrubHub I was very impressed! The grape leaves, hummus, tabbouleh and lentil soup were all phenomenal, fresh and properly prepared. I also enjoyed their traditional Turkish coffee and it did not disappoint. Everything was very fresh and full of flavor. Loved it! Fast delivery too! Took only 1/2 the time GrubHub had projected! My order was perfect and the food was very enjoyable. Will definitely be back!

The free general tsos is a hit or miss. I've always liked this place because it's super super cheap and the food is edible. My husband and I always eat for about $13. It's nothing fancy but does the trick for cheap Chinese. I usually stick with the chicken fried rice and crab Rangoon. And they always throw in a couple egg rolls for us. This a very modest family-operated Chinese food take-out place. BUT, they also make several unexpected dishes that are not on the printed menu. They are handwritten on signs inside on the wall. Good stuff.\nI frequently order their chicken wings, large whole wings made to order. And the cheese wonton comes with a side of warm sweet& sour sauce for dipping. Yum!\nThey are very friendly and prepare orders quickly. They will also accommodate special requests such as no mushrooms or extra spicy, etc. I thought this food was very tasty! The dumplings were awesome and the prices were very reasonable. I would definitely get Chinese food from here again. I have read reviews about how large the menu is, or people having to use the restroom right after eating here. Well Chinese take out restaurants typically have a large menu, I.e. Hunan chicken lo mien, Hunan chicken chow mien, Hunan chicken with white rice, Szechuan chicken lo mien etc. The menu is not really that big it's the same chicken with different starch and sauce or spice level. Picture a bar listing every wing entree, buffalo wing, BBQ wings, buffalo flats, BBQ flats, buffalo drumettes, etc. So that should not even really matter into this review. \n\nNow the bathroom comments, you eat, you go to the bathroom. That's nature. Maybe this time you get the \"runs\". Are you already under the weather? Should you even eat the spice you ordered? What did you eat earlier? Unless you are part of a serious outbreak, e-coli, bacillus, food poising, etc. these comments really have no need to be said either. \n\nWith all that said, this place is good, not great but good. The prices and the service speed is what makes this place have a value to me.  Everything ordered so far was good! I have had some bad tasting, sloppy looking, skimpy serving Chinese food. This place has not done that yet. However, human error will happen and I am sure I will be disappointed at some point but that will not effect my standing on this place. pretty average shop n save. I personally feel that it would benefit from a makeover. it just seems a little dark and old inside (compared to Centre Ave location) I only stopped in for a few things but even that was a pain. It was completely crowded and the horizontal aisle where registers are that leads to deli is sooooo small. its the main access to other aisles but its wayyyy too small. i was in here 5 minutes and that was enough. I want to love this place, sadly only like. Produce nonexistent. .no watermelon in July wtf... butcher must be Frankenstein. .all the cuts sketch and chicken always dripping with liquid eeewwwww. ..decent sales, fantastic employees! Shop here because it's close, go to Kuhns on Banksville for quality meat and produce This isn't a rating for the actual business as i didn't order or visit the establishment, but i did have the chance to try their chicken salad and it was pretty amazing! It isn't listed on the menu for some reason, but It came in a normal styrofoam container. Super full it had to be stapled shut and only $9! The salad had chicken tenders, croutons, tomatoes, shredded mozzarella (or provolone) and a few other things i could do without, green peppers, onion, olives, mushrooms. Oh!! And i can't forget the fries they were the best! Thick cut steak fries perfectly fried not soggy and not too hard. The ranch dressing was really good too, tasted a bit like eat n' park. I'll get a picture the next time we ate it a little too fast. Thats how you know you enjoyed your food! \n\n\nA little long for a review on a salad right? Trust me i've had many a bad chicken salad lol I was craving pizza and thought I would give this place a try since it's right down the street. The pics people had posted caught my eye bc it looked like a lot of cheese, which I am a huge fan of. However, I was highly disappointed by the taste of this pizza. The crust was bland and I actually discarded it. There was just nothing special about it at all. Ordered delivery one evening, as the sin of consuming most of a pizza seemed minor compared to other available crimes. Received the food in decent time (about a half hour, give or take a few minutes). It was hot and well-made. The crust was a little tough, but it was late and that happens. The sauce was good; not too tomato-y or overly sweet. The cheese wasn't the greatest, but was acceptable. The only complaint I had was that the overall pie was salty AF. I mean grab a beta blocker appetizer salty.\n\nConsequentially, I would recommend this pizza for parties and beer drinking, but not for any type of high expectations. It simply is what is. To whom it may concern, \n     I ordered from here a few times when it was \"Big Guys\" .... \"get this, and get that\" people told me. First delivery was a little long, food was good! Second delivery was even longer and food was good!!! Third delivery was so long that I called three times and still cooked my own food and was sleeping by the time they showed up. I chalked that up as \"hey they are new and busy\". Last two times I ordered a hoagie, burnt! Pizza burnt(same order)!!! Last order I said \"wings crispy with ranch for both of my orders of wings!!!\" Also ordered curly fries with nacho cheese! Wings where cooked enough to eat but not crispy, fries where burnt though! Nacho cheese was the best warmed item, however received no ranch but was charged for it! Delivery driver was as nice as can be and one of the best guest related people I have seen! So other than the tea that came with our meal and the driver being friendly this place is garbage. They did say when I called them up about the ranch they would give me extra next time with no charge!!!! What does that mean I get double the ranch when I don't need it but when I do just rough it out ? Best delivery salad ever.  I ordered their Grilled Cajun Chicken Salad, no tomatoes or olives per request.  I asked them to keep the fries and chicken on the side so it wouldn't wilt the salad during delivery.  They nailed it.  \n\nI also ordered a large plain pizza with extra sauce.  Their pie is a little doughy and chewy, but the crust is still crisp and light.  I think they use a coarse corn meal as opposed to flour on the bottom of the pie, which isn't bad.  Decent sauce and solid cheese coverage.  Would order again. Yinz Guys Pizza in Carrick on Brownsville Rd is the ABSOLUTE best Hawaiian Pizza in the Burg!!!\n  Huge slices and tons of toppings \n  Yummy yummy! They have amazing hoagies, calzones,  and huge pasta dinners. Salads are generous and huge with fresh ingredients. The staff and deliver drivers all know me and my husband from the neighborhood and stopping in for a slice or their great wedding soup. Glad to see there is nice pizza shop there after all these years. Good luck guys see you soon! Regardless of early or late they usually have a good selection of food, at lot of locations nearby like to tell you they're out of practically everything and you should order something else but not here. Went here today to check out the Nashville Hot chicken. Excellent customer service from the woman (Dana) taking my order. The wait time was short. I probably waited about 3 minutes at the drive-thru window. I got home, opened some mail/packages, then got to my meal. The chicken was so fresh! It was perfectly made. Crisp, juicy, & saucy. The only thing that was missing was the pickles which I didn't mind because the chicken was so good. The Nashville Hot sauce is a bit smokey and gets your nose running a little bit. The heat of the spice isn't overpowering and it doesn't ruin the taste like some hot spices/sauces do. I LoVe to come in and get chicken salad sandwiches on croissants and carmel machiottos. Tab is always friendly and helpful.  She is also very knowledgeable about the cups when they come in and I like that because I upgrade mine often. \n\nXander and Janice are also very nice and helpful.  I always see them cleaning when no one is at the counter, which is almost never, and they both always have cheerful happy things to conversate about. \n\nI do get frustrated when the employees don't have everything they need to do their job.  Or when my croissants run out or aren't made at all.  It'd be nice if things were a little more stable for both the employees and the customers. My favorite one in the city. They always get my coffee right (it's just hot/iced blueberry with cream, no sugar) which doesn't seem complicated but the DD on 51 always screws it up, as do Oakland and Squirrel Hill. I only docked this one a star because they never put enough chocolate icing on their donuts. The drive-thru folks are always friendly, too! I'm not a regular customer here or anything but every time I do come here, I'm disappointed. The customer service is always poor. This time, I felt rushed and I had no help with any questions. Eyes were rolled and my card was snatched out of my hand and half shoved back into my hand. I'm surprised my iced coffee didn't explode when it was slammed onto the counter in front of me. I also got a sausage egg and cheese croissant which was greasy beyond belief. Like I get that it's in the category of fast food but this was ridiculous. It tasted like cleaner. I'm giving this 2 stars because my coffee ended up being delicious. I'm just overall unhappy. It's a Dunkin Donuts shop like most others, so what you see is what you get.\nI like their dark roast coffee and it's been fresh every time I've gone there. Their hot chocolate is good too. When I take my son they put in an extra dab of milk so it's not too hot and it doesn't water it down like ice does - that's really thoughtful and makes him happy.\nBaked goods and breakfast sandwiches are average but consistent.\nService is average. I've never had any problems.\n\nThere are not a lot of places in this area to meet up with a friend besides the bars, so I am very happy they are in my neighborhood. Great customer service everytime I come in, especially at night. I always feel welcomed and comfortable shopping here. This is the worst convenience store in the area. They charged $2.50 for 1/2 gallons of tea, and $2.50 for Sarris Candy bars from fundraiser packs \n\n#NeverAgain Sam is from Greece, and makes the best Greek food in all of Pittsburgh! \n\nI only wish he would put kabobs on his menu.\n\nMy favorite thing recently has been the chicken pie. But everything on his menu is fantastic! \n\nStop by and check him out. WARNING: DO NOT ORDER THE LARGE GYRO WITH EXTRA MEAT! It will be packed with so much of their delicious gyro meat that it will be literally spilling out! \n\nI am pumped to review another amazing gyro place. I thought the place I found in Chicago was the best gyro, but this place may even top that one! \n\nMy wife told me about this place and we finally went there. I ordered two large gyros with extra meat and some stuffed grape leaves. The lady behind the counter was wonderful and very nice. I couldn't wait to get the behemoths they call a Large Gyro home and eat it. Once I got home I was stunned to find how much meat was packed into each gyro, Every bite I had bits of their perfectly cooked me and their delicious, obviously homemade tzatziki sauce spilling out. By the time I was done with both I was stuffed AND had an additional Meat Salad to look forward to later.\n\nFast forward a day. I heat up my meat salad and break out the grape leaves. The meat was still delicious microwaved, and the grape leaves were AMAZING, purely amazing. Hands down the best grape leaved I have had since my first.\n\nIf you are anywhere within the area and do not go, you are cheating yourself out of one of the most amazing and memorable gyros you will ever have. I look forward to trying other items on their menu! Great food great family I've been a customer for over 10 years always a healthy option Went here because of the reviews here and was not disappointed. I had the chicken gyro and baklava, both were delicious. The chicken was tasty and overflowing from the gyro.The owner was really friendly and let my try the regular gyro meat which was also good. 10 stars, no 100 stars for Sam's Sun Sandwich!!  Sam and his spouse prepare the freshest Mediterranean food in Pittsburgh and lucky for me it's right up the street... but I would easily travel far to get there because it's so worth it.  Parking is available right outside.  \n(There's also a parking lot across the street too.) By far they make the best home made grape leaves I have ever eaten.  Another one of my favorites is the sleek and baba.  Next week I'll probably get the hummus and mujaddarar, delicious lentil, cracked wheat with lots of fried onions. And you can even get whole wheat spinach pies, which I prefer.  Doug's fav is always the chicken roll because of the crispy homemade wrap. I've ordered here for years, for picnics, appetizers for lunch and for dinner. And you can also call ahead. We love Sam's Sun and thank you Sam and Sonny for your hospitality. Highly recommend Sam's Sun, good healthy food for pickup at good prices.  I get the Spinich and Feta pie or the meal combo Hummus, Mujddara and Sleek.  Great local spot Wow, Sam was such a sweetheart! My sister lives nearby and my bf was hangry. I avoid fast food so I trusted yelp to find us some food in Carrick. This shop had mostly 5 star reviews so we headed here.\n\nSam was super friendly and gave us the 411 on his Greek dishes. We both decided on a gyro. It was overstuffed and delicious! For dessert we went with pistachio roll and baklava. The pistachio roll was delicious but I was too full to try baklava. Oh, he also gave us a sample of his homemade hummus..... amazing!!!\n\nSam Sun sandwich had the best hospitality and customer service that I've experienced in a looong time. Please don't overlook this shop. The owner is eager to serve you his homemade food while chatting with you. Went to Sam's after reading some of the reviews and living relatively close by. Ordered a chicken gyro, spinach pie and grape leaves. Was not disappointed...the food was excellent. Chicken gyro was loaded with tender white meat and the cucumber sauce has a great taste. The grape leaves were excellent as well. I made the error of ordering the plain spinach pie and not the spanakopita that I meant to get, but it was still very enjoyable. Great food for a reasonable price! The baked kibbi is amazing and grape leaves are second to none. I come here once a week at least. Sam and Sunny are super friendly. This place is a hidden gem that you must try if you like Greek/Mediterranean/Lebanese food. Everything is homemade and I haven't had better anywhere. Highly disappointed with my ribs at the Pittsburgh Rib Fest. They were bland and dry. I've had good smoked ribs prior to this experience. My fathers friend makes them, so I know good smoked ribs when I taste them and sadly for Bad Azz theirs definitely didn't make the cut. Also, the beans were too spicy and mushy and the Mac and cheese tasted like the kind you could purchase from giant eagle or Walmart. Not impressed. Not sure how they won any awards with these. Best ribs I have ever had!  I have visited them during the Rib Fest on multiple occasions and the rib flavor and sauce is the best around. All I can say is, I recently saw 2 people wearing BAD AZZ BBQ t-shirts in COSTCO buying about 30 rotisserie chickens - the already cooked ones - not raw chickens. If they sell premade Costco Chickens as their 'quality BBQ' I think I will go somewhere else... We don't order delivery from the Carrick location anymore, we drive out to Brentwood when we want Pizza Hut.  Yes it's inconvenient, but it's better then taking your chances with what you'll get from this filthy, unorganized, slow location. \n\nSince the health department hasn't gotten around to shutting them down yet may I suggest calling your doctor to make sure your current on all your shots before you bite in. That is if you can get sold of anyone to place an order in the first place. \n\nYears from now we are going to learn on the news that the reason why they never took orders was because they only delivered to their friends who called them on their cellphones.  When they dropped off the pizzas we are going to find out they were dropping off drugs! At least this scenario makes sense. I waited 1 hour and 45 minutes for my pizza to be delivered. Then when I got it, it was cold! I was so hungry but refused to eat that stuff! Ordered online with Pizza Hut at 9:39pm, was routed to this store. Estimated delivery was 10:09, tried calling at 10:44 (store is \"open\" until 11) received message that store was closed. \nChecked my credit card statement, was charged and then refunded. \n\nI'm guessing they didn't feel like doing the delivery or even bothering to notify me. \n\nI won't do business with this store or any of the franchisee's stores again. The franchisee apparently is Aurora Huts LLC, which owns 55 (all?) of the Pittsburgh area Pizza Huts. After 7 visits, I'm conflicted about this place. The food can range between average and good but the rest is sometimes just weird. They claim to have delivery but there is always an excuse why they can't \"today\". Several times they were closed during normal business hours. Once they wouldn't take an order unless I came in first. These \"cons\" get tiresome after time and are the reason I often decide it's not worth the trouble.\nAs for the food, I found the chicken tenders to be good. The perch was below average or way over cooked, while the others graded much better. The Cod and Talapia were my favorites. The sides were generally good. I didn't try the wings or desert. I only received a delivery order once.  The wings and shrimp were excellent. I have tried to order for delivery numerous times and was told they are not delivering. If you don't deliver please do not advertise as so. Well if your like me , then when something is advertised as delivery and it is not... Well you are disappointed. Also they have a dining area but that is not accessible \n\nOn the food.... Yes it is good fried food. The chicken is tender, the frozen fries are crisp. But, there are to many other places that offer the same exact ingredients. Yes the lemon pepper season is welcomed but you can literally get the same at hooks in Mt Oliver ... At a cheaper rate The turnover rate at this business is very high. When they are fully staffed with people who can read their customer service is great, however; most of the time their staff consists of uneducated Illiterates who can't cook, let alone read the order screen.  The Sky might fall if they have to make change!\n\nThe new hot dogs are disgusting! They may have been good, but the night shift couldn't grasp the concept of what I ordered and I ended up with a gross mess of crap. The gyro is huge! Same with falafel. Hummus is creamy and fantastic, but I wish it came with more pita. The food here is incredible! I've never had their traditionally American foods, I've never felt compelled to, considering how good the middle eastern is. But people tell me it's good. I've never eaten in the restaurant, always got pick-up, and the wait is never too long for that. Great little shop! Love this place.  I had their food at at a catered event and it was great.  Everyone raved about it.  so I used them for a family party and was even better,  We got grape leaves chicken shawarma sandwiches gyros spanikopita  etc.  They were great.  The owners  checked in with us to make sure all was good and were more than hospitable and reasonably priced.  Family Restaurant is now our family favorite restaurant.  When friends and family come to Pittsburgh from out of town this is where they ask to go. The food here is as good as everyone is saying.  But let's come back to that.  \n\nThis humble little Mom and Pop restaurant is on a neglected stretch of Brownsville, near Becks Run Road.  It doesn't look like much from outside, but don't be afraid to go in.  It also doesn't look that great inside, but don't let that bother you.  There's a pizza counter  and a dining room off to the left.  \n\nThe decor is an eclectic combination of dusty items from an earlier Chinese restaurant, a hookah pipe, and needlehook wall hangings of landmarks that cannot be identified.  There's a Syrian flag hanging with the name of the family written on it in Sharpie.  It smelled of cigarettes when we entered, but I don't know if that's always the case.  It is important to note that the men's room was very clean, that's always nice to see.  But, this isn't the place for a nice date, unless you're both about substance over style.\n\nThe service is understated, but efficient and polite.  Pop wasn't a talker, but he seems like a nice guy and regular patrons clearly thought of him as a friend.  It's always nice to see immigrants make an investment in a neglected neighborhood.  The cuisine is a mashup of pizza/hoagies and middle eastern.  \n\nWe ordered the mezze platter, lamb kabob salad, spinach and lentil soup, and a gyro.  Everything was really good.  There was also plenty of it.  I bought the mezze plate to take home and share with my wife as a snack later.  We fed on it for two days.  The lamb pieces were lean, well done and seasoned with the perfect middle eastern blend of sweet and savory spices.  The tzatzikis was creamy and the perfect accompaniment to the rich savory slices of gyros meat.  The soup was soft and flavorful with a vegetarian tasting base stock.  Compliments to the chef, they do it right.\n\nBottom line...great food, you need to try it.  If you go take-out you ain't missing much.  But then again, you should enjoy the eat-in vibe at least once. Seriously, people...eat here!!! Don't put it off until another day, get up & go NOW. Their Chicken Shawarma sandwich is the best I've ever had and it's huge. The Mezza Platter has been so fresh every time we've had it. Tabouleh-YUM, Hummus-YUM, Baba Ghannouj-(to die for)YUM. Can't speak for their American fare because I've never felt the need to try it. If Middle Eastern cuisine is your thing or if you never tried it, but wanted to,...then give this place a try. Enjoy. I ordered a bacon pizza and breaded mushrooms.  Disgusting is putting it lightly.  The was hardly any bacon on the pie and the pizza was greasy and soggy.  The mushrooms were burnt and when I bit into one of them, my mouth filed with grease.  I threw the whole meal in the garbage. **When you Google \"Anthony's Pizza Brownsville Road,\" the number for the Millvale Anthony's will show up. Be mindful - they are not the same Anthony's. ***\n\nI used to eat here all the time in the 90's. My family was really sad when they closed their doors.  We were thrilled when they reopened.\n\nWe got 2 large pizzas. One plain & the other banana pepper/peperoni. Delicious! Very thin pizza for someone who has never had it. The cheese is greasy & has a unique taste. The sauce is sweet. If you're into that, then this pizza will exceed your expectations. \n\nPizza Bagels are a must! They have a very different taste than the pizza.  \n\nPersonally, I think this pizza is best when you eat in. (They took down the wall of 80's Hollywood Stars - Bummer). The cheese is so gooey and flavorful when it's fresh from the over. It's worth it to dine in if you have the time. \n\nI'm very happy they are back in business! They did upgrade so now they take credit cards and debit cards. A few negative things about the place. They close at 9PM during the week. I believe for Summer they should have extended hours because they do have competition with yinz guys pizza which is a block away. They are open until 11. They are losing business. Even if they stayed open until 10 it would be better. No air conditioning in the place. And everytime I call the phone number it goes straight to a voicemail saying they are on another line call back. I can never get through to a person to actually order anything. So happy they are open using Anthonys original recipes. The pizza is the best around.  The hoagies are awesome.  The Iced Tea is the original recipe, I've yet to try it Welcome Back!! Have attempted to call in to order a few times recently, but it either rings and goes to voicemail or goes straight to voicemail. Sketchy business practices I tried to order pizza from Anthony's on a Wednesday evening. My son was playing in a baseball tournament in the area and Anthony's was one of the sponsors. I had a slice of their pizza at the ball field earlier in the week and I was hooked. I stopped in the shop around 5:30 before the game to grab a menu. I was informed that the menus have not returned from the printer yet so I took a picture of the menu on the wall with my phone. I told the woman behind the counter that I would be returning after the game to order about 6 pizzas. The game ended at 7:30 and I started trying to phone in my order but all I could reach was their answering machine. I took this as a sign that they were extremely busy so I decided to just drive up and place my order in person. They were closed. 7:30 PM on a Wednesday. Needless to say, I was extremely disappointed especially since I informed them that I planned to place a large order! I took my business to a shop closer to my home! Their loss!!! This place is such a gem! My boyfriend lives in the Southside and if we're not in a rush on the weekends we'll drive up to Carrick for breakfast at Gary's. The decor is reminiscent of a 90's small-town Italian restaurant (think plastic plants, brick arches, etc.) but the food is actually REALLY great diner breakfast. We've never waited for a table and never paid more than $15 for breakfast and coffee for the two of us. I would definitely recommend checking it out if you're in the area! Gary's has been around for over 20 years. It's a small place that's only open for breakfast and lunch. We go for breakfast there so I've never seen their lunch menu. The breakfast menu is straightforward. I typically get the same thing-1 egg, 3 strips of bacon, home fries, and toast. They use Mancini bread for the toast. YUM!!!!  They have other menu items like pancakes and waffles. I keep thinking I will order something different but I always order the usual. Bacon and eggs is a comfort food for me. Eating at Gary's is like eating home cooking. Who doesn't want that??? Consistently good..love the Mancini raisin toast. Friendly, prompt service! Best breakfast in town! My husband and I go here every Sunday.  They have specials only on Sundays which are always so delicious.  There are about 8 different specials to choose from, varying from different omelets to sweet embellished waffles or French toast.  Their basic menu is also widely expansive.  Besides the awesome food selections are the amazing people that work there.  They are always so friendly and accommodating, I cannot recommend this place enough", "stars": 3.7}, "Crafton Heights": {"year": 2016, "text": "Everything good that you've heard about this place is 100% true and then some.   This literally has to be one of the best kept secrets in Pittsburgh.\n\nThey say to make sure you get there early.   It's true, and there's a reason why:  because the donuts are off the shelf amazing and the people are friendly and helpful.  You will never find pastries or service like this at Dunkin' Donuts! Love stopping by this place before the dentist office (right after it opens). Nothing fancy and the perfect pit stop for homemade/local donuts to bring to work. They keep it simple and sweet with their selection. \n\nRight now I'm a fan of the glazed - just melts in your mouth!!! Only my second time here so far and I'm hoping to make this a traditional stop every time I have my visits. Literally the best doughnuts, ever. I have now lived in NJ, Philly, Boston, and Pittsburgh and would keep going back to Better Maid if there was one in every location. Please go. Do it for yourself. The quintessence of donuts. Open despite past roadbumps. I like 'em all, but they do cake so well. Get there before 9, or, even better, 8, if you want to be guaranteed anything. Shel Silverstein danced in my head as I pulled up to what looked to be an abandoned little building atop a small hill on a dark, cool Summer's morning in Pittsburgh.\n\n\"There is a place where the sidewalk ends and before the street begins...for the children, they mark, and the children, they know, the place where the sidewalk ends.\"\n\nThe only lights telling me something was alive were that of cars nestled in the grass awaiting some sign. With a window down asking if this was the place, an elderly woman declared \"for over 50 years young man, it is the place.\".\n\nAnd such was same story after story as we lined up at 6am awaiting the opening Of Home-Maid donuts, a place that can only be described as a quintessential donut experience in a world gone gourmet and chain.\n\nMy Story for the History Book\nAt 6am when it opens, things remained dark but locals told me \"they open when the donuts feel like they are at their best. They aren't ready\". I laughed wondering if these were people or food, but as the smells hit me I started to understand how these things do come to life in a magical way.\n\nThe place is just a little shop surrounded by nothing and easily missed. Outside of the faded address number being a donut and the smells, easily missed until the Fresh Donut wood sign is walked out.\n\nEntering, there is nothing special but everything special. Two cases of donuts. One coffee stand. Overflow of donut love by this one man crew.\n\nThe Donuts\nThe locals introduced me as Chicago and moved me to the front of the line telling me their favorites. The owner joked and said his is \"the last one\" but recommended the sugar or cinnamon. Basics! We went with two of each kind. Given there are only 12 different types, you can see these are keep basic and simple.\n\nYet...\n\nThe taste and texture is out of this world. You can hear the crisp snap of the donut as you rip or bite into it. The moist flavorful dough hits you perfectly while the topping ratio is perfect. There is just enough to compete the package without any one thing overwhelming you. Fresh isn't enough to justify these.\n\nI don't have a favorite. Go with what you love and you won't go wrong! However, sprinkles remain key to me ;-)\n\nGo here. Don't waste time at the trendy spots! If I'm ever passing through or staying, I'll be back for sure!\n\nTip: locals say sold out by 8-9 easily\nTip: opens at 6 on weekdays but that is a loose time. No apologies for it because the donuts need to be ready \nTip: weekend lines are crazy I'm told\nTip: cash only Best donuts in town.  If you want to get them, your best bet is to be there when they open at 6:00 am.  I've stopped by at 6:30am before and all they had left were donut holes. Dunkin Donuts Who?????? Every bite, every chew, gives you a mouth watering sensation that will leave you taste buds screaming for more.  I constantly heard great things about this place, so i had to see for myself what the hype was about.  Let's just say I may never go to Dunkin' Donuts again Best doughnuts ever!! I could go to this place every day. Get there early because he sells out early. These donuts really are better maid! Somehow they manage to be crispy on the outside, yet cake like on the inside. Minimal deco on the donuts, because they are just that good! I'm warning you that you better get here early because I'm pretty sure they sell out every morning!", "stars": 4.5}, "Dormont": {"year": 2017, "text": "Went to this place with my family on a Saturday night. We had gone to Thai Spoon, first. It was crowded and we didn't have any reservation, so we left empty handed. Did a quick yelp search to find out other good rated eateries nearby. Found \"My Thai\" and off we go. Once we reached, we found the place empty, not good. Still, we wanted to try this place going by yelp ratings. We ordered - crispy spring rolls (shrimp, chicken and veggies) - it was just OK, there was no shrimp in the shrimp rolls. Crab Rangoon was good, I tried this dish for the first time, have to try at other places too. Then, we tried the Veggie Sampler, crispy egg plant was awesome; crispy tofu was good too. After that, we ordered Pad Thai (Chicken), Fried Rice (chicken) and veggie fried rice in entrees. It was again average and chicken was undercooked. Service was good and the lady attended us with care. Overall, an average dine out experience in Pittsburgh. Wow! What a gem! After passing this place a hundred times we stopped for a late dinner. The service is amazing. \nThe food is phenomenal!\nI love that u can get ur pad Thai at any spiciness level starting at none...for people like me with kids!\nMy daughter had the mango juice and I the mango mojito which were a great compliment to our meals.\nA good beer selection as well.\nThe dumplings tho were just phenomenal! Most authentic style dumplings! The way u can customize ur sauce with the pepper flakes and their chile sauce which complimented anything!\nParking can be a pain...actually it can just plain suck!\nBut a block or two walk is worth it! Greetings fellow Yelpers!! This is my first submission of a review. I have used Yelp for several years now to find, check in at, and leave tips for, some wonderful establishments. However my life has changed. I am dating a Yelp Elite now!! She has shared with me that if I ever wish to join her ranks then I must review. Challenge accepted!!  I chose to kick things off with My Thai for two reasons. One, I've only been there twice, and both occasions were with the Elite one. And two, on each of my visits I was blown away by not only the cood, but the calibre of service as well! I have two Thai dishes, Chicken Pad Thai and Green Curry Chicken,  that are first to be checked off at any restaurant before I start bee bopping around on the menu. My first visit which was about six months ago found me up against the Pad Thai. It was not my favorite offering ever, that title still goes to Green Mango,  however it was much closer than I expected it to be. Unfortunately remembering that it was really good is about as much as I can share. It was half a year ago, and we eat out A LOT!!  We found ourselves back this past Friday and it was time to give their Green Curry a go. Let me start by saying they have a 1-5 heat scale which is a little new for me. I usually enjoy a 4 to 5 on a scale of 10, and was going to order a 3.  Boy am I glad that my lovely date talked me into getting a 2!! The heat was not overwhelming, but I fear it would have been at the next level. Everything about the meal was absolutely perfect! The first thing I noticed were the amazing colors. The broccoli, and green peppers were very vibrant and nicely complimented by the brownish purple tones of the bamboo shoots. And everything was pulled together by the bright white hue of the excellently prepared chicken! I will happily ecclaim that this was in fact the best Green Curry that I have been served, and I will return to enjoy it again! While the food is certainly the star of the show at My Thai their wonderful staff do everything they can to steal some of the spotlight. They are extremely friendly as well as attentive, plus they don't hesitate to give you a very informative input regarding your dish of choice. This visit as well as the dish deseves a 5+ stars rating! Overall My Thai is a solid 4 stars and we will not hesitate to return the next time we are in need of some Thai goodness!! I hope you find this review helpful!! Happy eating! This is an awesome little local spot in Dormont! The food is so good, and everyone working there was super welcoming! The menu is primarily sandwiches, but the selection would be sure to please. They also have mac and cheese that you can add different toppings to - I chose the bacon mac and cheese and I was not disappointed. The papagiorgio sandwich was sooooo good. The location itself is small, so it might not be the best for a large group of people, but it's definitely somewhere to check out. They also have a catering menu, and from the homemade eats I sampled I'm sure it's worth a look. Favorite place to get a breakfast sandwich in Pittsburgh. Super friendly staff, awesome coffee, awesome food. Go to Parkers! On Monday nights, this place is a good idea. A little weird having wing night at a Mexican restaurant, but on the inside, Jose & Tony's is more reminiscent of a dive bar than anything else. According to my inlaws, J&T is an institution that has been around for ages and in their day, had a group of loyal regulars. It still seems true, the bar area was a scene of general comraderie as everyone watched a Pitt game together, and it was a nice friendly atmosphere. \n\nThe wings were cooked to perfection and half price, and the margaritas were $3. Lots of TVs so you can watch the game while you eat. It's really pretty great. \n\nIgnore the Mexican food (which from the reviews sounds like it's pretty sub par) and get some wings and beer. \n\nOrdering style is odd. Order and pay at the window, they'll bring it out to your table when it's done. Clean up after yourself before you leave.\n\nI really think that if they didn't call themselves a \"Mexican restaurant\" and instead embraced their diveyness, there would probably be a lot less one star reviews from people who came here expecting something else entirely. Campiti's is family owned. They recently (in the last couple of years) changed owners, which has brought a few changes to the restaurant itself and a little change to the taste of the pizza and sauce. They now except debit/credit cards. They have a small dining room, big enough for smaller parties and dinner dates. The pizzas are good. The sauce is on the sweeter side. The pizza is served very hot and the crust is crunchy, so be careful (I cut the top of my mouth every time). The prices are good for both the pizza and hoagies. I hear the hoagies are very good, but haven't tasted one yet because the smell of the pizzas gets me every time! Their bevi's are sold per can, two liter or 6 packs of soda. They also have available for sale, frozen pizzas to heat up  in the comfort of your own home! Although not a large joint and with a very limited menu, Campiti's Pizza offers up some really delicious food.  Fast service and friendly staff makes the visit all the better.  The place seems clean which is always a big plus. I highly recommend a visit when you're in the area. Have got take out from here twice now. The first time I would give it 3 stars, this time it was better.\n\nI have gotten drunken noodles both times and it is pretty tasty. Not the best Thai in pgh I have ever had, but still good. I get spice level 4, which makes you sweat a little, but not be unbearable. The vegetable egg rolls are good, but please add vegetable dumplings! \n\nFood is always quick and fair in price. Portion size is large. My husband and I share one meal without having leftovers. Much better after being open now for a couple years...more substantial flavor & portions. Both were light when they first opened. \nNice expanded seating now which makes for a better atmosphere.\nI love the lunch specials. Great place! Long wait, but def worth it! For all the hype of this South Hills breakfast spot...meh. Just stay in the city for breakfast/brunch. World famous hot cakes? If you're into dense + chewy...perhaps. There are plenty of omelettes and other savory selections, but they just aren't that special except for the jumbot and the melt in your mouth Italian toast. The coffee is average and the service is anything but friendly -- not a good impression for a first timer. A favorite place to go for breakfast.  Like a diner from days gone by. Great breakfast spot. Their pancakes are amazing! This is a go-to place in the South Hills. The service is always friendly and fast. Casual and laid back atmosphere, good coffee. A Pittsburgh staple. I took my family here for breakfast when they visited from New York and they loved it too. I rarely order from Papa John's but thought I would give it a shot. I used their app to order, which could use an overhaul. The app isn't very user friendly. It took about 1 hour & 15 minutes from the time I ordered until the time it got to me. I paid with a card & included a tip. \n\nThe driver didn't know what he was doing. He stopped by my place, then left, then came back a few minutes later. He left his truck running in the middle of the street, came towards my door, turned around & went back to his truck. He then knocked on my door. He gave me the food. I turned to put it down & he walked away. He didn't give me a receipt copy nor asked me to sign anything, & never said anything to me.\n\nOnce I opened the boxes the pizza looked alright but was like warm in temperature. One of the pepperoni in the boxes looked liked it was bitten into. The bottom part was missing. Overall I was extraordinarily disappointed in how poor the food was & what awful service I got from the delivery driver. I will never order from this place again. Things have been going down hills. Everything is soggy I live five minutes away and I can't get food properly. Over charged for soggy food! Don't ask for special orders ie not tomato they won't get that but charge you for it. Good brunch spot for the weekends-- very casual, pleasant staff and Bloody Mary/ mimosa bar Great specials from wing and shrimp night to brunch. They have a great menu, very good food, friendly staff and plenty of tvs. The only issue for me was parking isn't plentiful since its on street parking on West Liberty Avenue and the bathroom was a bit run down. I had bananas Fosters pancakes, bacon and a mimosa. They had fixins set up to add strawberries, blueberries and other fresh fruit. I loved it. The pancakes had a rum 4amd it was so outstanding I didn't eat syrup at all. The bacon was crispy and they gave me plenty. I enjoyed the server he's been there 17 years and he was a well versed on everything we asked. I'm looking forward to going back on a Wednesday for wings and shrimp. This place is great for sporting events there was a soccer game on when we were there so the tvs in the back had the game on while there was football in the bar area on the tvs. It was a nice blend and everyone was enjoying themselves. Its a feel good environment and I'm looking forward to going back. Always love this place! One of my go to favorites. Tonight was a build your own burger with grilled onions,  pepper jack cheese, and cappicola, loved it! Especially with Ranch dressing!! Family had gourmet Mac and cheese with pulled pork, bbq sauce, fried onions, creamy greatness!!! Parents had the Cuban sandwich, with roasted pork, ham, Swiss cheese, pickles. Both loved it, a must try if you haven't had one. Dad had French Onion Soup for an appetizer, 5 stars for that!! The broth was so aromatic, onions were delicious, topped with melted provolone cheese! Cain's is always a winner!! Have to dock one star off my previous review for the absurd prices. Every appetizer is $10 now? Burger almost $15?\n\nStill a great place but wow did the prices go way up. I have the distinct privilege of being able to work on Potomac Avenue in Dormont. There are so many great places to eat in Dormont, but Freido's continues to be my favorite. My meal is always ready quickly when I order takeout, and I have yet to be disappointed. By far my favorite menu item is the steak, ranch, and french fry toasted sub! Amazing! I'm also a fan of the wraps.", "stars": 3.8}, "Downtown": {"year": 2017, "text": "In short a great experience, especially if you are new to Pittsburgh.\n\nMy wife and I had never heard of this place before coming to Pittsburgh, but several local people told us it was one of those \"must do\" Pittsburgh stops.  Even though the place was packed, we had a real friendly server who took the time out to tell us the history of the chain and explain the food options. We got a couple great sandwiches and some chili cheese fries (my wife got a vegetarian Deluxe Double Egg & Cheese and I got a Capicola with Cheese and an added egg at the suggestion of the waiter).  \n\nThe sandwiches come standard with a vinegary type of coleslaw (not creamy - almost like a fresh mild sauerkraut) and french fries inside, along with whatever else listed.  It was like nothing I have ever had, but after an initial bite or two trying to figure the flavors out, I dove into the sandwich headlong and loved it!  Doubt I will have anything like it anywhere else, it will always be etched in my mind as a part of Pittsburgh - though I hear they are expanding all over the place! I love these places!  Anytime I get a chance chapel back to you, like to go to a good deli or sandwich shop. I really love this East Coast feel in the good old fashion Decor, it reminds me of my childhood in Baltimore in the 60s and 70s.\n\nPittsburgh is an awesome place and if you  love food, there are many many choices here.\n\nI had a steak sandwich... just ok Over-valued sandwiches! The meat tasted like canned meat....  the bread is plain white and ohhhh the French fries literally the worst I have had in my life! I would never come back. I did not get the magic of spending 30 minutes on line for this..... Amazing sandwich. Never imagined French fries and Cole slaw INSIDE a sandwich . Delicious!! Pastrami sandwich like other locations except a little skimpy. Cool local staple in Pitt. A must try if you are traveling through. Great local blue-collar meals. \nCapicola w/fried egg, provolone, slaw, fries all in between thick slices of fresh Italian bread. \n\nNot 5*?  Sort of a dive. Hometown good, but not pretty. There's a lot of hype about this place, and I honestly don't see why.\n\nEvery seat was full when we walked in, but we were able to grab the last 2 seats at the bar. The servers were friendly and quickly got us some local beer and took our orders. We started with the tater tots, and they were by far the best part of the meal. Crispy and delicious. Served with a horseradish sauce. Yum. Then the lunch quickly slipped downhill. I ordered the Salami and Cheese sandwich which came with almost no meat or cheese (less than 10% of contents). The fries just tasted like a mush of plain potato and made up at least 50% of the sandwich. The cole slaw was tasteless (20% of sandwich). The bread was fresh, but there was just too much of it (20% of sandwich). Nothing was seasoned or salted, and everything about the sandwich was bland and boring. I even salted, peppered, and added hot sauce to my food, but nothing helped. This was a very inexpensive meal considering the portion size, but even so, it was not worth the price.\n\nSorry Primanti Brothers, but I won't be back. Me and my girl visited this place last weekend for our small out of towner to Pittsburgh and was told by the locals to come here for a good sandwich. Holy cow was our meal awesome! First off this is a tiny little spot that seats about 20/30 people. We both ordered a drunk duck which was like a amf drink and came with a really cool little rubber duck in it. Next came our entrees and she got the pittsburger which came with fries and cole slaw on it and I got a kielbasa with cheese which also came with fries and cole slaw, and we also shared some freakin delicious chili cheese fries. All in all it was an amazing experience and the only reason I gave it four stars was because the waiting staff passed us around a couple of times and it got a little confusing. Definitely recommend coming back! I have never ever had a bad meal from here! Their Turkish pizza is out of this world. I usually get the pide with gyro. Their hummus is a must order as well. 3 stars, friends loved the pizza. Every piece I picked up fell right apart. It's okay. Still smallest portions in the greater Pittsburgh area. Staff are still nice, but guac has been consistently browner than usual for no real apparent reason...? Avoid this one and go to the others if you can. Made a reservation and was sat promptly. I felt a little like royalty with the amount of attentiveness shown by the staff. The portions are huuuge and beyond amazing! This place is a little on the expensive side but this is definitely a case of.. you get what you pay for! I\"m a big fan of the Ruth's Chris brand.  It's consistently good no matter where you are, and you can count on the big, fat delish steak and some humungo sides!\n\nWe popped in here w/out a ressie just after Christmas to visit w/some family we hadn't seen in awhile.  They were able to seat us at a table in the bar, which was great since we were drinking some nice wine and getting a little boistrous...:)  All the food was great - everyone had steaks and we shared some sides.  \n\nExcept my poor dairy-free partner.  I\"m sorry to say it, but do not come here if you have a food allergy.  There's just nothing they can do to accomodate.  He had the fish, which came out dry and tasteless (apparently they don't have olive oil - only butter??!!) and was quite frankly the price of a steak, and none of the sides were really exciting for him - I think we had the steamed broccoli.  bla.  \n\nLook, I'm a fan.  But only go and spend this sort of money if you can really get the true steak-cooked-in-butter and everything-has-butter-and-cheese experience. This place is a great addition to the Pittsburgh restaurant scene. I went with friends on a Saturday night, we made reservations, but it didn't seem grossly overcrowded when we got there at 7. The drinks were really cool, and they seemed to have a decent beer selection as well. I got the 1/2 lb of brisket, and I was so happy I did. They give you buns and toppings to make sandwiches and there was enough for me to take home which is always a treat. The mac and cheese was great! \n\nI will say that the service was a little disappointing. The waitress we had was very nice, but didn't really tell us too much about the menu. I thought this was odd, considering this is a new restaurant so it should have been a safe assumption we may not have been there before. As I said I got the brisket, but I didn't know it would be coming with topping and sides to make a sandwich. It was a pleasant surprise for sure, but should it have been a surprise? There are sauces on each table, but we were never told what any of them were.\n\nI'm hoping they work out those kinks as the time passes, because this is a great new spot. I will definitely go again. This place is not friendly to people with celiac at all. Usually bbq is gluten free because it is just smoked meat and spices, but here they spray soy sauce  (which contains gluten) on all their smoked meats. Normally I would not let this count against a place, but I made reservations and specifically noted I was gluten free and they said it would be no problem. So when we show up and I can't have anything but a few sides it was very disappointing.  The atmosphere is cool though and the bar is fun, but I probably won't go back. The meats are AMAZING!  Smoked, lean and tender.  The BBQ chips were very different....and enjoyable. Loved the Cranberry BBQ seasonal sauce. Only disappointment was the beans....not sweet at all. I like brown sugar/molasses beans. Very noisy. Drinks were incredible. Pork and Beans was really good! Just not as good as Union Pig & Chicken. (R.I.P.) They do sell 40's so pour a lil out for U.P.C. It was our first time there and we had a great experience.....we got a booth which was good as the alternative is sitting at long tables and virtually eating with strangers.  The brisket was fabulous and the pulled pork very good as well!  The potato salad was the only thing that we didn't care for as the potatoes were too hard.  Our waitress was awesome...Kristen (sp?) was helpful and very friendly ....we enjoy going to events in the cultural district and this will be one of our preshow favorites.... I stopped by the week it opened just to make a reservation for the following week.  The woman who made my reservation was so nice she convinced me to stay and eat.  Marie was her name I think.   I had the hot brown and greens.   Both delicious.  The next week I came with friends.  We had cocktails that were amazing and the meat was heaven. We dined at pork and beans for the first time tonight. It was delicious and fun. Our waiter was very knowledgeable and friendly. We had the house made charcuterie board, dirty fries, pulled pork and pork belly. We enjoyed everything. I am from Texas, and this spot felt like home! I definitely recommend this restaurant. It is unique to Pittsburgh and a most welcome addition to the dining scene. We will absolutely be back to sample the rest of the menu! We were able to get an early reservation on a Tuesday evening, a few weeks ago. With it being our first visit, and being pretty unsure about the communal tables that I had read about in other  reviews, we specifically requested a booth if available. I really appreciated the text that I received from the host confirming that we would be seated in a booth, a few days before the reservation.\n\nAs for our experience at the restaurant--it was absolutely fantastic. Our waitress was very helpful in offering many suggestions while we tried to navigate their extensive beer list. Yet, she didn't pressure us into making decisions hastily and gave us plenty of time to comb through our many options. The food was amazing--we tried the deviled eggs of the day (crab), dirty fries, brisket, pork belly, mac n' cheese, loaded potato salad, and marinated cucumber salad. My girlfriend immediately said, \"We have to come back here, again!\" after only a few bites of the appetizers--she's never that quick to make such a emphatic judgement on a new restaurant. We decided to play it safe and just stick to the original BBQ sauce, but it was one of the best sauces I've had--and I can be quite the BBQ snob when it comes to any place but my own kitchen.\n\nI read other reviews that said the portions were small and that the value for the price was a little bit iffy, but I definitely disagree. Sure, our bill for two was north of $80, but we left with a ton of leftovers and were very satisfied with the meal and experience--quality isn't cheap! We both would highly recommend this to anyone that loves well executed BBQ. The latest and (literally) greatest installment in the Richard DeShantz restaurant group's campaign to Make Downtown Pittsburgh Great Again. I love M&P, tako, and Butcher & the Rye. But since I am downright obsessed with barbeque, Pork and Beans is my new favorite restaurant in growing culinary empire.\n\nMy partner and I had the brisket and the spare ribs. Both were excellent, but the spare ribs were To. Die. For. Seriously! A ribs lover's heaven.\n\nThere were four sauces for us to choose from. My favorites were the seasonal (kind of fruity, tangy when we were there in December) and the spicy.\n\nThe draft list is extensive, with nods to both local and seasonal brews. It's not a list for hop-heads though; of the ~30 beers on tap, only two or three of them were IPAs/Imperial IPAs. Personally I would love to see at least a few more IPAs available, but perhaps it's a seasonal thing and we can expect a bigger selection in warmer weather.\n\nThe cocktails were excellent. My partner had an expertly crafted Manhattan. I had the Euge, which was pretty unique combination of spicy, nutty, chocolatey, minty and citrus. I enjoyed it for the novelty and felt like I was in Pirates of the Caribbean. Next time will probably opt for a more classic flavored cocktail though.\n\nIt doesn't seem like it's really worth it to make advance reservations, unless you can specifically request a booth style table. They will seat you at a communal table if that's what's available, and there's not a lot of elbow room at those tables. We had a reservation but were able to sit down earlier at the bar, where you can seat yourself on a first-come basis.\n\nI can't wait to come back and try all the tasty meats! Extremely average. Fries were WAY over salted, even for teenagers. Did a lot of research on beers based on menu on their website only to arrive and find that they do not keep their website menu current. Most draught beers were different. Grrr! How hard is it to upload a current menu? Cummon! Kale caesar salad had very little kale. Hot Brown and Double Down were misses. Brisket Sandwich and Slaw were decent. Service was lacking, had to hunt-down AWOL waitress on numerous occasions for water refill and the like. Disappointing. I was very excited when I was able to get a last minute reservation, as I love tako and I knew Pork and Beans wouldn't disappoint. The atmosphere is great- there is a mix of booths, communal, and bar seating, and is very hipster chic. If you love beer, the menu was huge and fairly priced. They also had a few ciders on the menu, which was nice to see. We ordered the pig ears, pulled pork, and mac and cheese- all 3 were great, and the mac and cheese was the best I had in a long time (it has crumbled BBQ chips on top!). \n\nFor my food allergy friends out there, Pork and Beans was incredibly accommodating. My waiter made sure everything was safe and really went out of his way to make sure I could enjoy my whole dining experience, which is honestly rare to find these days. I can't wait to come back and try out more of the menu next time I'm in Pittsburgh. Managed a chance to go to Pork & Beans a couple weeks ago for a happy hour then dinner. The drinks are interesting spins on classic drinks and some are just totally off the wall. \n\nWe decided to try a variety of items including the brisket, the pulled pork, the mac & cheese, all delicious. Wow. Just - wow. This was some pretty amazing food. We had deviled eggs, brisket, pulled pork, cucumber salad and jojo fries. Everything was fantastic. The meat had such a great smoke flavor, that no sauce was necessary. It was tender enough that you hardly needed a knife. Service was great - our waitress was friendly, prompt and made great recommendations. I usually don't like sitting at a shared, long table. But it works here. Seriously - check this place out ASAP. You won't be disappointed. We've been wanting to try Pork & Beans since walking past the \"coming soon\" sign in its front window last summer.  Our BBQ roots are from Texas and we haven't had tremendous luck in finding true, smoked meats with authentic sides while spending some of our time in Pittsburgh.\n\nThe restaurant has an eclectic, yet rustic feel.  I'm not crazy about the metal fencing that separates the bar area from the restaurant and equally not crazy about the long, communal tables that provide most of the seating.\n\nThe beer list is extensive.  We ordered chicharrones to start with; crispy, fried pork rinds served with a slightly spicy remoulade.  We followed with brisket, pulled pork, collard greens and mac&cheese.\n\nThe meats were flavorful; but the brisket could have had a slightly more smoky flavor.  The collard greens were tasty, but some of the grit that can be found from less-than-fully rinsed greens was still present.  The mac & cheese was sinfully rich.\n\nPork & Beans comes the closest yet in delivering the BBQ tradition that these two Texans have been searching for in the land of Three Rivers.  Kudos. Was very eager to try one of the newest Downtown dining spots, and utilizing the Yelp reservation system, was able to secure a late evening reservation, one day in advance.\n\nParking wasn't bad, with there being an abundance of parking garages close by. I'm a big fan of Valet, but the surrounding Valets were charging $15, far more then what's come to be a standard around the city.\n\nThe restaurant itself has a cool, rustic vibe to it with the  aromas of BBQ sauce hitting you as soon as you walk in. We were seated at a communal table near the back of the restaurant. Luckily for us we were place on the end of the table and had some open leg room to one side. Those couples seated in the middle of the table certainly had to find the space cramped, and a little invasive. You have to be prepared and ready for everyone to share in your conversation, and constantly look over at what you're eating, etc. Definitely not for everyone.\n\nThe food itself was exactly what we expected. If you're name is \"Pork and Beans\" you have to deliver on the meat, and that's what they did. Brisket cooked perfectly, with fat that melted in your mouth, mac and cheese seasoned perfectly and the pickled accompaniments set the entire platter off right.\n\nFor the price, and the quality its really worth checking out, and would definitely recommend. We had a great time in the laid back, fun and energetic venue. Our waiter was very knowledgeable and helped us through the menu of vast options. We settled on loaded fries, ribs, pork belly, brisket, greens, mac & cheese, broccoli salad and the baked beans with potatoes wedges to boot.  We have few leftovers and didn't really care for the pork belly ( way too fatty even for pork belly) but enjoyed every other item. The Leonas ice cream sandwiches (which we all love) because they are local and yummy were a great way to end our meal. \n\nPaired with Voodoo Met and a few Moscow Mules( with Titos)! Drinks were well made. Great place. Another win for this restaurant group. We had the mint julep cocktail, it was fantastic (not sure how I feel about it being served in a tin can) but the drink itself was perfect. We tried the dirty fries, the pork belly, and the pimento cheese and it was all FANTASTIC. Our server was great, but her name is escaping me (short hair/bluish green?) I will definitely be going back. Excellent food excellent service. Highly recommend!!  Great chili. Had the ribeye loved the smoke flavor. Having lived in Texas off & on for 32 of our 37 year marriage, my wife and I have developed that regional palate when it comes barbecue.  Pork & Beans is the closest yet we've found in Pittsburgh to that style, and we loved our meat choices.  We had the tri-tip and one of the day's specials (a Korean rib) which perfectly hit the spot; the tri-tip was the best we've ever had.  Ours sides were the burnt edge beans (superlative!) and the loaded baked potato salad (al dente is for pasta, not potatoes).\n\nA 4 vs 5 star rating based on the potato salad, and the fact that they didn't acknowledge we were celebrating our anniversary despite having asked if it was a special occasion when we made the reservation and me having disclosed that fact - if you're going to ask, at minimum have your front desk host/hostess acknowledge it ...and maybe throw in a free dessert. Ate here a few nights ago. Very cool spot. Reservations will get you better seating. If not you may get seated at the almost picnic style seating in the back area where they have very long tables with like 12 chairs on each side and you're sitting next to strangers. A little awkward. Food was dope though. I had 2 snacks; the deviled eggs plate and the brisket walking taco. Both were amazing and I highly recommend. The check was cheaper than anticipated also! An amazing addition to the Downtown area. We couldn't wait to try it and weren't disappointed by anything. Not sure how large the people who complain about tight seating but we had plenty of room for the two of us and enjoyed talking to new friends. \nWe got the pulled pork and beef brisket. While both were good the brisket was absolutely amazing - fork tender with a great crust. Sauces were all tasty but honestly the meat was worth eating plain.\nWe split the dirty potatoes as our side, and they were the perfect combination of spice and gooey cheese plus a ridiculous number of BBQ bites.\nThe total bill with a couple beers each was less than $70 and well worth it. We had a half pound of each meat and the potatoes and couldn't finish it all. We'll be back soon to try the rest of the menu! Great atmosphere and great food.We had the pimento cheese, spare ribs, tri-tip and of course, mac and cheese, all were yummy. Also, they have an amazing beer list, with tons of stuff on draft. Service was excellent. The staff know and are there to serve you. Be aware - everything is shareable. Food, tables, and sides are up for grabs. If you're trying to have a romantic date - be sure to ask for a booth. I would recommend the catfish sliders and pulled pork. Had the double down and it was excellent. I have been here about half a dozen times.  I like to bring out-of-towners here.  The rooftop bar is great and has a lovely view of the city.  The meatballs are a fun concept.  One of my go-to restaurants. Nothing great. Would not go back. Meat balls were just okay. Nothing else on menu to choose from. We went to Mezzo (second floor), and ordered two different pasta dishes. One with lamb, the other one vegetarian (cannot remember exactly what vegetables were included). My husband and I both felt the pastas were undercooked, way below getting to the al dente stopping point. Too crunchy. Maybe it was an off-night. Perhaps will return to try the pizza or the Emporio. Every few years my family makes a short trip to Pittsburgh and looks for a nice place to grab dinner. We found Sienna Mercato on Yelp, walked in off the street and were happy to find they had room for us.  We were impressed by the excellent, knowledgeable service and delicious food, especially all of the Italian specialty dishes. They also had an impressive selection of drinks and created a wonderful, enjoyable atmosphere where it was still quiet enough to hear one another speaking. A huge thank you to the management and staff of Sienna Mercato for being so helpful and accommodating with our group of 70 or so. We were hesitant earlier In the day when they said they could handle our group, but the hesitation turned out to be without merit. They immediately sat the majority of our group, and had the rest of us with tables within 10 minutes. The servers were on top of it, and the food came out quickly and was delicious. We also really appreciated the vegetarian and gluten free options. Management checked in multiple times with the group leaders to ensure everything was taken care of. You are all rockstars, thank you for making our group's dinner a success! I'm so close to giving it a 4, but I can't because their signature thing - meatballs - wasn't that amazing. I got the matzoh ball soup which was really good, tender balls, hearty broth, perfect balance of salty and doughy. Then I had the poutine with mushroom gravy and a beef meatball on top. Poutine was top notch, fresh fries, melty perfect cheese curds, and delicious gravy. However, the meatball was a little dry and didn't have much flavor. \n\nBut the ambiance was nice and the staff was great, so I'd give it another go if I'm ever in town. Also would love to try their upstairs charcuterie. I'm a big fan of the rooftop in the summer- great vibes but very busy. It would be very easy to enter the restaurant and not be aware of the other floors- I was dragged along by friends, so I'm lucky to know about the top floor. I've only been for drinks, so I can't rate the gluten friendliness --but I'm excited to go again. If you're looking for a fun atmosphere for late night drinks, I highly recommend it! Worst food ever , it seems like these people stores the food and deliver the next days by just heating .we went with our family and every one had food poisoning .\nI will request every one not to have food in order to safeguard our self and avoid doctor's visit. Delicious food, good service, a little too loud.. Loved the place, will return\n\nServer was friendly, attentive and had great suggestions.\nBrussels sprouts as an appetizer were DELICIOUS.\nCame here for my sons 25 birthday. 2 of us got the Risotto, 1 got duck, 1 mushroom ravioli. Biggest complaint was there was too much food. The food was out of this world.  I can for brunch and it was very good.  However the service was awful.  The restaurant was not busy (one table of 9 steeler fans) and a spattering of people here and there.  I waited for 30 min for the food to come.  If it wasn't for good company I would have left.  This is a great location with great food but please fix your service. This will be this restaurants downfall in this primo location. I haven't had the food yet but I already feel motivated to write a review. Walked up to the bar for a quiet meal by myself while traveling for work right after two men did. The waitress didn't even look at me and I waited without a menu or as much as a hello for over 5 minutes before I walked over to where four waitresses were gathered to plead for some service. I'm looking around me and the businessmen around me at the bar are immediately greeted and given normal expected service. I had to flag another waitress down to give my order and she didn't take my menu or tell me about the wine specials, which I would have taken advantage of if this whole experience turned out better. This is the worst service I've received so far and I can't help but feel discriminated as the only Asian or even minority woman in the restaurant trying to just have a quiet decent dinner while everyone around me is acknowledged and served immediately.\nCan't wait for the food. The reviews and ratings are pretty accurate. The food was very average. I wanted to like this place so much that I made myself think I liked it more than I did. But, the more I got through my meal, I realized that I didn't like it that much. And by the time I left, I settled on a \"meh.\" I ordered the shrimp and scallops risotto. I should have gone with my gut, but I've had great experiences at 3-star rated restaurants, but it was not the case here. \n\nThe waitress warned me that the dish had a lot of risotto and most people do not finish, but I had no idea. It was sooo much risotto and only TWO scallops and about 4 shrimp for about $30. Way too overpriced. Lessen the massive amount of risotto and give an extra scallop or two OR lower the price. It is not worth it. As far as taste, it was okay. The risotto was a little salty and not too edible after about 5 or 6 bites. It was really cheesy, which normally is a great thing, but not for this dish. I really just ate the scallops and shrimp which were pretty good and cooked almost perfectly. I also ordered a side of truffle fries, which were, again, just okay. Not bad. If I came here again, I would probably get a burger. It seems that most people here were eating burgers. So, maybe that is the way to go. \n\nOverall, it was a three. My waitress was pretty helpful and she genuinely tried to engage in conversation with me so that boosts the rating. You can try some of the other menu items, but you've been warned. Ok, stayed in the attached hotel in News Year day. Being a little traditional wanted pork and sauerkraut for good luck. Called and the said it was one if there specials today. AWESOME!! Told them we'd be there in 10 minutes they said good. Showed up and ordered 3 specials. Well that was the last good experience. They said they were all out. They weren't that full at the time. Not sure how what appeared to be one of 2 servers didn't know what was going on in such a small place. You can see the kitchen from I think every seat in there. Food was as expected. Service lacked, server came back about 15 minutes after receiving our food. The kitchen lady that delivered our food did her best to assist us but wasn't her job. Then he only came back with the check after that. Overall small menu and wasn't exceptional for the price. I've been here twice. The first time was wonderful, I got to sit by the chefs and conversed with one which was new and different for me. The waitress was nice but not attentive. All the dishes had some aspect of it I didn't think I would enjoy. I requested the shortrib mac with a different cheese because I can't stand bleu cheese (and what mac and cheese ever has bleu in it, for real?). She gave me a substitute and I chose Gouda. It was marvelous! I told the chef and she said I was a genius for changing it out! I don't like how expensive everything is either. Some plates are large, but you really don't know until you get it. The second time wasn't as good. I put in the same request and was told they could not substitute Gouda today because they don't have any. They offered the cheese sauce used for the kids dish. Didn't taste nearly as good and felt kind of cheap but still same price. Probably won't go back if I can't count on ordering the same thing which can't be a slam dunk every time, at least not at their prices. A Lovely gathering place located below Hotel Monaco. Cool interior. We sat at the bar. Pleasant bar tenders. Husband ordered the Bitter Resentment cocktail with blackberry shrub. Holy deliciousness!!! I am going to say it is the best flavored drink I have ever tasted. Yes, it was that damn good!! I had a San Pellegrino. I enjoyed an entree of Tikki Masa, it was served with very fresh pita, do they bake the pita in house? It was that fresh.... Flavorful dish, a bit sweet, as is this kind of dish, but I loved it. Leszek had the Buffalo Cottage Pie, it was served in a skillet and was topped with Whipped potatoes and filled with a savory gravy, ground buffalo and veggies. I ordered a glass of Commoner Cabernet, bottled just for them from California. I had to save it for after dinner as my Tiki Masa was to spicy to enjoy a glass of red. This wine rocked. We will return. My wife and I stumbled in this place while visiting Pittsburgh from California. We sat at the bar and had some drinks for about 2 hours.  drinks were excellent and the service was very good from the bartenders.  We did not eat, but the restaurant was packed and people waiting.  \n\nBartender said they have really good breakfast there, but we didn't get a chance to enjoy it.  Would be back for drinks though, plus it was in walking distance from our hotel. \n\nGreat place to come and relax in a very nice restaurant/bar atmosphere. We went on a Friday night before a show. Best parts: Nice ambience, ample beer and drink list.  The food was edible but pretty mediocre. We started with brussel sprouts which were soggy, but, hey, soaked in cheese sauce? Sure, we finished the dish. My husband had the bison burger, which was good. I got the mussels for my entree which were tasty and a large portion, however, unfortunately, were served in a narrow pot with very little broth at the bottom.  This design of the pot does not work for the mussels, as the only accessible mussels for the first half of the meal are very dry with no easy way to get broth on them. I would come back; but probably just for drinks and some snacks. Food and drink. Staff very nice however a little bit slow showing and attending to the customers. Please, please, please remove the display from the center of the main entrance. You can't walk by when people are sitting at the tables and and there is a line. Everyone has work bags in the morning, impossible to navigate. Otherwise, fantastic baristas and great location. We enjoyed our fries and two complimentary drinks ..\nWe stopped in before going to dinner and loved our time here..the bar manager is so friendly, knowledgable and our food was equally wonderful\nIf you are going to a show ..check out the new menu and the honey crisp cider cocktail ! Absolutely beautiful restaurant. Bartender was extremely knowledgeable and made great recommendations as to what we should get. Food was very fresh and super satisfying. Not good, none of us liked the food that we got and I had to try to order three different times to finally get something. They did not tell me that my selection was not available until everyone else's food was done. Then came back after that and told me my second selection was not available. Finally I got my third choice but was really disappointed because the sandwich that I ordered was full of mushrooms even though that ingredient was nowhere in the description. While the people working there were nice enough about everything, I just did not like the food. They did mentioned to me though that they have a new chef and they were going to implement a new menu so maybe that is something. A group of 6 of us went in at 6:00 on a Saturday evening without reservations. They had one table available which was reserved in 90 minutes so we had to be out by then. We agreed and I'm glad we did. Joanne, our server, was amazing. She explained everything very well and steered us in the right direction. Everything was excellent and the portions were a good size for the price. Definitely recommend to everyone. It's just plain shitty here. Service, cleanliness, all of it just shitty. I have no other words to explain how bad it was. I'm guessing the owner was there (his picture is everywhere of him partying).  Older large man with shaggy brown hair cared only about himself and his friends rather than any other customers. Never again! Remarkable! It is absolutely remarkable that an entree that would be perfectly average at $8 should cost four times as much. The $32 sea bass consisted of two dreary rectangles of poorly filleted, bland white fish adorned with parsley. College cafeterias do this dish better. It was by far the most disappointing restaurant meal I have ever had. My fianc\u00e9 and I have been eating at Bravo Franco for years. We loved the food, customer service, and romantic atmosphere. We were so excited to try Peter Allen's when we were back in the Pgh area but a little disappointed. Our waitress was very friendly and nice. She had great recommendations and was attentive. However, the menu is basically the same as when it was Bravo Franco but with jacked up prices. The break was pretty stale. Our entr\u00e9es were hot and tasted fine, but they were out of 2 options that my fianc\u00e9 wanted to order. He ended up with a baked potato that was no way near worth $8. I had the chocolate mousse for dessert which tasted like regular pudding with Hershey's syrup dumped all over it..not what it used to be. Might try it again.. Went here 90 minutes before a play.  Started to worry a bit when it took 20 minutes to get our drinks. We asked if we should just order an appetizer since if the food will take as long we will run out of time. We did order the meal and made the play at the first call chime. Food was good. The atmosphere was very pleasant. You could carry on a conversation since there was no loud blasting music like most dahntahn restaurants which are primarily TV bars. Will go again in a few weeks. Came here for New Years - horrible! I wish 0 was an option. Our table took 20 minutes to prepare past our reservation time, all of the tables inside had dirty glasses, very VERY slow paced, expensive and overpriced food. We went before a play at Heinz Hall. We were greeted warmly and received quick and friendly service from Michael. I had the pot roast pierogies and two selections from the bar, Braddock's Smash and a Sazerac. I was pleased with all of them. The architecture of the building that holds the restaurant is also worth checking out. I will be getting frites next time so I don't have to steal my sisters. Very convenient to the downtown theaters. I plan to return again. Had lunch here while in Pitt for the weekend. I enjoyed a double cheeseburger and fries, with a delicious mouth watering cherry Coca Cola. I think I may now have a new favorite fast food burger... :) My review based on my visit in November 2016. I was in town for the Legendary Haunt Tour 2016. I was on a mission to find a place for lunch one day. I walked the general area looking for the best food option around. I scanned through Yelp to make my final decision. I decided to try Diamond Market. \n\nIt was nice outside, so I asked to be seated outside on the patio area. I was alone when dining, so I was easy. My server greeted me promptly and took my order. I went with the Cheese Steak and Pittsburgh Poutine. The meal was at a reasonable cost. \n\nThe food came out in an efficient matter of time. The cheese steak had a lot of warm drizzling cheddar cheese sauce every where. It was so good. The Poutine was ok, but not terrible. Check out my photo to see what my meal. It was great overall in flavor, tender, seasoned well, and was enough for lunch. \n\nI would have left a higher rating but the service was awful for me. My server started out great, but he just disappeared after he gave me my food. I didn't get a refill on my water and I had to wait for him to return with the check. Sadly and for some strange reason, he never came back. I ended up with another waitress. I hate to judge and make a false statement, so I won't. I just hope he wasn't offended by my lifestyle choice because he looked uncomfortable towards me in the beginning. \n\nBesides all that, I would recommend coming here for a nice warm meal. The cheese steak was very tasty. I would pass on the Poutine sadly. 3 dollar mimosas and super kind and helpful staff! Would definitely come back! Everyone was so nice Sometimes you need a good dose of vitamin c, especially during the sub zero temp producing months in PA. Juicing is a good way to get your nutrients in a tasty and natural way. Check it...\n\nThis juice bar is a stones throw from my hair salon which makes it a convenient stop on my way to or from. The menu here is quite simple with smoothies, juices and shots being the main options. The fiery lemony cayenne Defense shot is a sure way to open up your sinuses and throat.  It's a heavy dose of wake up for sure and it makes you feel alive. At $4+ per shot, they aren't cheap but they are worth it. Acai bowls are all the rage now and they have them here along with regular yogurt bowls but I've yet to sample. There are always treats near the register which look like energy type bars. They carry a line of protein powders and raw coconut oil if you're interested as well. \n\nOrders are prepared right under your nose at the counter. On my last visit, I had the Vitamin C Booster which was a mix of citrus, carrots and ginger. If you aren't a fan of a grapefruits bitter aftertaste, this might not be for you. I found it to be tart yet it was a good contrast against the sweetness from the orange and the spike from the lime. Very good.\n\nThis is another Eat n Park venture and the space is shared with Hello Bistro making it convenient if you go with someone that wants something more substantial. I can't wait to visit again to try more from their delicious menu. Always very dirty and extremely rude. Bought a full meal that looked as if it had been sitting out for hours. I've been to quite a few McDonald's in my life time and it's safe to say this has been the worst. I've given it a few chances given its convenient location, disappoints me even more every time. I visited the Sonoma Grille for the second time in one year - and had similarly disappointing, below average experiences both times. Our server was slow and forgetful. We waited 20 minutes for our drinks, only to discover that he hadn't even put in the order. The food we were served wasn't even remotely close to what was described on the menu. And everything was over-dressed, under-seasoned, and poorly executed. Plus, their entire menu is overpriced. I can't think of any good reason to ever go back - very disappointing. I received a beautiful bouquet as a gift from Harold's today. Despite difficulty with the delivery address, they persevered and got the flowers to me. Made my day and the flowers are gorgeous! We decided to get a car for New years eve last minute to avoid crazy uber fees and Tony Williams made is super easy.  Did an inquiry on their website, received an email a hour or so later with some pricing details and then called and reserved the car.  The car was clean, the driver was very friendly and the entire process was simple.  Will definitely use again and would highly recommend. Amazing restaurant great food. We went for restaurant week. One of the few restaurants with many different choices, something for everyone. Love the service, we didn't feel rushed. Geez is this place pricey. It is also sort of a \"tiny food\" place where you don't get a lot for the cost. We only went because we had a huge gift card and still ended up paying more than we usually would for a night out.  Steak wasn't anything special, I wouldn't go back unless someone was paying for me. Staff was plenty helpful and friendly to us even though we were clearly out of our element with the expensive atmosphere. Another restaurant week, another visit to Capital Grille.  You really can't beat the price for the great food you get!\n\nCaesar salad, Filet w/Green beans and mashed potatoes, and cheesecake with strawberries.  Always scrumptious, always cooked to perfection. \n\nIf you are interested in trying Capital Grille - Restaurant week is always a great time to go - great price for great food! After running around all darn night and morning getting ready for my vacay I decided to stop in the capital grill for lunch. I was greeted immediately upon my arrival and the hostess stand checked my coat and luggage. It wasn't busy at all for a Thursday afternoon I would have to blame it on the rain because the menu options were superb. I was torn I came in to try out the restaurant week menu but I couldn't take my eyes off the lobster roll and Parmesan truffle . I ordered a goose Bloody Mary which was decent heavy on the goose which I prefer...The bartender Katie was kinda distanced at first but me and another patron got her talking and she warmed up quickly:). As shown in my pics the serving size for the fries and the roll was good for a lunch portion . Now when I think of Parmesan truffle fries I think of shoestring style fries I was presented with thick cut fries with no Parmesan....now don't get me wrong y'all know I haven't met a fry I didn't like . It's just I had a different thing pictured.  The lobster roll could've had more seasoning it was pretty bland The brioche roll was to die for. Was I dissatisfied with my lunch noooo I was way to hungry for that was I blown away... not this time Excellent service, food and presentation. This location lived up to the Capital Grille reputation in every respect. It happened to be Restaurant Week so that was a nice surprise. The plan was to splurge a bit anyway since we were dining to celebrate my birthday. I had the Kona crusted NY Strip, mashed potatoes, and Lobster Bisque. I also ordered the garlic shrimp as an appetizer. The steak was perfectly prepared and pretty much melted in my mouth. Above all else Capital Grill takes a tremendous amount of pride in their steaks. \n\nThe mashed potatoes were excellently seasoned and had some skin mixed in for a nice contrast.  The lobster bisque was smooth, creamy and included a nice amount of lobster meat. I usually don't prefer lobster bisque but this was a very nice change of pace. The shrimp took the cake (what can I say, I love shrimp). They were huge and very filling. Only caveat is the garlic could have been more pronounced. I would suggest mincing as opposed to cloves. All in all it was an excellent meal. Can't go wrong. We went in yesterday to check it out the night before .. Ricardo, the manager was able to accommodate us with seating in the bar area for tonight ( restaurant week) .. When arriving tonight.. We were personally greeted by Ricardo who remember us .. And the bartender also who waited on us last night .. We then were seated in the bar  area of the Roost where we had a wonderful conversation with Bob the bartender and as our sever ! He was very knowledgeable .. As for dinner .. The Murray's Chicken and Petit Filet were amazing ! The filet ranked within the top 3 of best steaks which  by my husband ! Yes he ranks them !! Very tender .. But .. All in all.. We had a wonderful night and I would definitely recommended having a dinner date there !!! Ate at Roost for restaurant week and the service was amazing. Bob, our waiter was very fast and friendly despite being the bartender as well. Our food came out quickly and perfect. I first ordered the shrimp Gumbo which was absolutely amazing. My wife had the winter harvest salad which was really good as well. We could have eaten these as our main meals. I ordered the pierogies and she had the chicken breast. Both were top notch and affordable. I would highly recommend this place and can't wait to go back The only reason this place got 3 stars is because the food is outstanding. The service is deplorable. We sat at the high tops and the bartenders were more interested in BSing with the regulars than they were with actually serving the customers. We were halfway through our meal before I caught one of the manager's attention to ask for napkins and two more place settings. 15 minute wait after asking for the check, then another 10 minutes til we asked again. If you got time to sit around all night, this is the place for you. Again, great food, terrible service. Because of our positive experience at the Revel, we decided to try the Roost on Thanksgiving Day. It's hard to imagine this interpretation of a traditional Thanksgiving meal. The entrees and sides were served in small soup bowls, three bowls on trays with no serving utensils, and we were each given a tapas plate. We sent the gravy back because it was not hot and we ended up picking on the \"bite-size\" pieces of dark meat. We tasted the sides, but we never tasted the turkey breast or ham which appeared dry. We packaged nearly the entire dinner ourselves. So basically, my husband had soup, a glass of wine, a dessert, and I had a kale salad and two glasses of wine. We gave the food I packaged away to a homeless person outside the restaurant.\n\nThe base price of the Roost was $17 per person higher than The Capital Grille, where we completely enjoyed our Thanksgiving 2015 dinner. The Roost will be remembered by us as the worst Thanksgiving dinner in our 60 some years.  We should have voiced our concerns to the server at the time but instead communicated with the manager by email afterwards. We were offered a gift card to Roost, not Revel, but declined. Why would we go back? Came in for breakfast and was so pleased. I'm pretty picky about breakfasts because a lot of times restaurants and especially restaurants in hotels can just skimp on them. Plus being gluten-free, I'm usually stuck ordering an egg dish. I ordered the buckwheat pancakes and they were some of the best gf pancakes I've ever had. The bacon as a side order was great too. (Again so many restaurants have cheap-tasting bacon.) for $10 I had a perfect breakfast. My husband was also very pleased with what he ordered. We are from Kansas visiting to watch our beloved Steelers beat the Browns!!! Everything was delicious and very fresh, highly recommend this place. Came back after 2 years and barring one, nothing else has changed. They let go of fried fish in Wild Curry (which I drove for 5 hours for) which hurt me, physically. The wild curry itself remains my personal favorite. Yummm ...\n\nEverything else is still amazing! Got their lunch special and it was delicious! I ordered the Pad Se Ew and asked what the spice levels were, the lady on the phone said it went up to 10, so I ordered a 5. When I got to the restaurant to pick up and she confirmed my order, she said the top spice level was actually a 5. I was a little nervous my food was going to be too hot. \n\nWhen I sat down to eat it, I forgot I even asked for spice and didn't taste anything. Besides that blunder, the food was really good!! Don't think for a minute my granddaughter and I did not know that you did not want to serve us because we were black your sign  which you lied and said you were closed was not even turnt we saw it as we came in and went out and your door you knew it would have been closed and locked you didn't either. But you let us enter and stand for a minute and then say we're closed in the language we almost didn't get then your Sidekick across from you nodded his head I'm going to report you so don't think for a moment we didn't realize it was because of our skin color that you did not want to serve us now maybe you have served blacks before but folks just have to know you did not want to serve these two blacks and my granddaughters feelings you truly did hurt and she is  also a chef she went to college for it she really wanted your food so thank you for keeping racism alive From this location, I've only ever ordered delivery through Postmates. The portions are decent for the price. I did get lunch with a salad once and they put the salad in the same bag as the food so I ate a hot salad. Yes I liked the food. This was my first time here, so ordered little less than intended. After tasting I liked it and looking to go next time as well. The dine place is some what crowded and small. So prefered the takeout. We've been itching to return for dinner here because the food was so memorable the first time. We were not disappointed. The steak and salmon entrees were both outstanding. Nice specialty cocktail too. If you're looking for vegetable dishes, you'll be limited here. Fun for a dinner date before a show! Excellent food and amazing staff. I really like the vibe here as well. The crowd varies from yuppie to urban. The drinks are incredibly elaborate and the food is extraordinary. I have never had a bad time at the joint. Although, it may be challenging to get seated or attention from the bartenders on a weekend night. The dining environment was so narrowed and crowded. I could hear every word spoken by the couples next to us. \nIt's hard to believe this is a highly ranked and recommended restaurant in Pittsburgh since the steak was totally not worth the price (and the 1hr waiting time). There was about 1/3 of the steak was fat. And if you don't order any of the 8-dollar side dishes, all you can get is the beef and the bone marrow. I can't say the steak set was not savory at all but it was just too expensive for that amount of \"edible\" meat, and the variety of the steak set was the least I have ever had.\nI should believe some of the negative experiences listed in other reviews before I went and I recommend you should too.\nAlthough I don't like the food at all, the service was fine so I rated Meat & Potatoes a 2 star. Meat & potatoes for two. So SO yum.\n\nBf and I were here about a month ago for dinner and libations. We ordered the \"build your own\" meat & potatoes for 2 for $75. This sounds like a bit of a hefty price tag but it is so so so worth it. An order includes a 45oz rib eye served next to their signature bone marrow gratin. So tender. So savory. I'm making myself drool just thinking about it. For $2 extra we also got chimchurri sauce (other sauces are available though, depending on your taste) as well as a side of truffle fries and mushroom ragu for an addition $8 apiece. While all that added up pretty quickly, the truffle fries were seasoned to perfection: evenly but not too heavy handedly and definitely some of the best I have had in a long long time. The entire meal was so good and the portions generous enough that we had enough to take home for lunch the next day.\n\nThe drinks, however, did not impress me so much. I am far from a connoisseur of craft cocktails, and since I am aware I know nothing, I always ask the experts (aka the bartender). Our bartender that night wasn't super helpful. Based on my preferences, he recommended the dark & stormy but bf was already planning to get that so I asked for another recommendation. He had none. This baffled me because.. I mean, he's the one that makes the drinks right??  I picked something else but didn't care for it and ended up not ordering a second because I was a little put off by that point (and also super stuffed from all the meat & potatoes).\n\nAll in all, would definitely recommend giving this place a try. The ambiance is nice. Dark and romantic enough for a nice date or boisterous enough for a girls' night for drinks and chat. Great drink menu.  Try the Manhatten.  Everything we ate was very unique, and delicious.  The pimento mac and cheese app was cooked perfect.  We also had the flat iron steak and lamb.  Flat iron is normally code speak for cheap piece of meat, but this was a one inch thick cooked perfectly meal.\nA negative:  your neighbor table is very close to you. A great meal - started with the bone marrow, enjoyed the pork chop and flat iron. Everything was perfectly seasoned and the root to berries cocktail was delicious! Definitely worth a wait. Always make this a stop! Great late night eats! I have so many mixed feelings about meat & potatoes. The food is excellent. The decor is beautiful. The seating is the most comfortable ever. the tables along the right hand side are very intimate..if you want to get to know your table neighbs. The deals on Monday night are fabulous--$5 gourmet burgers, $3 fries and many other options. The brunch and Bloody Mary bar are to die for. But the music and ambience, the patrons... all make me very uncomfortable. I'd rather listen to dinner music than listen to a dj spin techno over breakfast or while having a late night meal. This is one of those places that I can never remember to make a reservation for before a show . If you been following my day at all you will notice I been eating my way through Pittsburgh today . I'm going all in then I'm in serious diet mode. So my city crew decided to dine here for restaurant week 3 courses for 35 bucks. Since I had a late lunch I only ordered drinks and appetizers. To get me in the mood for Puerto Rico I ordered Malibu rum which they didn't have so she made me some pomegranate something or the other... I seen chicken livers on the menu and got excited can't remember the last time I had them. As pictured they came out fried to perfection and so tender yuuummmmers. My next appetizer I chose was the pate which was definitely more on the sweet side for some reason rather than savory. My girlfriends loved there food however I couldn't tell you what it was. Our waitress Jessica was the bomb. I would definitely comeback House - Had a wonderful dinner Monday, January 2, 2017, having 8:00 p.m. reservations. Pittsburgh was quiet after the New Year celebrations and so was Meat and Potatoes - several open tables and places at the bar, which sits in the center of the large dining room. The room is circled by half booths in velvet with heavy 2-person white marble top tables that were nice and sturdy. I have mobility issues and there were no steps to get into the restaurant and our table was near the entrance so I had a very easy time getting to the table. The cushioned booth side I was sitting on was quite low and I was afraid I'd have trouble getting up as my leg strength is the problem, but I was able to make it up fine. There was a large still water bottle with a bale top stopper that the hostess poured our water out of. The glasses are plain and heavily weighted. The water was not chilled, which I would have preferred.\n\nCocktails & Appetizers - Our server was Crystal, a wonderfully cheerful and polite young lady, who happily shared her best information and advice on drink and food choices. I had a Mexican Honey Bee which was strong but good, and my husband had a Dark and Stormy, which was quite too strong for me. We ordered fried pickles with spicy ranch and an order of the poutine. We did not care for the fried pickles appetizer and did not eat more than a bite - the pickles were not like dill flavored. They were very strong and overpowered the ranch and breading. The poutine was a new dish for both of us and it was absolutely delicious with a lovely gravy with melted cheese curds and scallions that really made the flavor pop.\n\nSalad - I ordered the Cobb salad and it was a very large oval plate with iceburg carpaccio / bacon lardons / tomatoes / maytag blue cheese / egg / avocado ranch dressing. The carpaccio is only indicative of the fact that the iceburg is sliced into thin flat rounds. Probably won't be able to tell this since it's piled up with condiments. This was a lovely salad with delicious bacon lardons that I wish were more plentiful, but the blue cheese and avocado ranch dressing simply clashed in a very distasteful way. I'd definitely get this salad again but just leave off the ranch and ask for blue cheese only. I can recommend this salad based on that stipulation.\n\nEntrees - After consulting with our server Crystal about the specials, I decided to go with my original idea of the Wagyu Flat Iron - smoked fingerling potatoes / celery root / maitaki / soubise / pecorino compound butter - and after reading another Yelp review, I asked to substitute Confit potatoes instead of the fingerling potatoes, but Crystal said it would not be possible based on how the dish is put together (everything coming combined underneath the steak). The steak was absolutely the most delicious steak I have had in YEARS. It reminds me of the grass-fed beef from my childhood. It was so worth the $38. I ended up just getting a side order of the confit potatoes and they were fantastic - crunchy on the outside while fluffy, soft and delicious on the inside. My husband got the Pappardelle - bolognese sauce / pancetta / pork shoulder / garlic bread - this was a delicious dish as well and very economical at just $18. The bolognese was almost like stew meat and very plentiful in the dish  with fewer but very large flat noodles. The garlic bread would have been much better had it been grilled. It was quite chewy but definitely not a deal breaker. My husband was very happy with this dish and would definitely order it again. One last note about the evening's specials, Crystal was very nice to guide me about the extremely small portion of Octopus (3 oz) special available, which definitely helped me greatly in my entree decision making.  \n\nDesserts - My husband ordered the apple cheesecake which was in a jar with crumble topping and he said it was delicious and not overly sweet, which was very pleasing to him and he would order it again. I ordered the Pot de Creme chocolate with whipped cream topping and caramel popcorn topping which was absolutely delicious together.\n\nThe bill came to just under $150 and we ended up taking virtually all the dishes home with the exception of the fried pickles, which Crystal had taken off our bill. This was a very nice gesture and was not expected at all as there was nothing wrong with the dish except just the taste to us was not pleasant. This was one of the best dinners we've had in quite a while and it just makes me want to return as soon as my wallet rebounds.\n\nDecor/Environment - Five Stars\nFood - Five Stars\nService - Five Stars\n\nWe hope your experience is as pleasant as ours was. Enjoy! Great service the food was really good trio Medallions was prepared as ordered and the filet was great.  Nice wine list.  worth a visit Delicious lobster bisque! The filet mignon was also to die for, as well as the salmon. The atmosphere was sophisticated yet relaxing.  The wait staff was excellent and personable. Would highly recommend for an upscale date night. Went to Eddie Merlots in Downtown Pittsburgh. 4 of us in total. It was my first time here, but I've been to other similar places in Pittsburgh(Hyde Park, Capital Grill, Ruth's Chris, etc.) and this was right up there with the best. \n\nThe service was great. Quick, knowledgeable, and super friendly. \n\nThe food was also great. I got the 7 oz fillet and I added it to be \"Oscar style\" which was great because I am a big crab fan. It also had the sauce and a few pieces of asparagus. We had some sides of mashed potatoes and cauliflower. The prices were what was to be expected. 2 other got the fillets which were all cooked to perfection. 1 person got the cedar plank salmon and it looked delicious. It was a nice size piece also. \n\nThe drinks were stiff but great. \n\nWe had some cake and cr\u00e8me brulee for desert and everyone enjoyed it. I am sure I will be back at some point. Hopefully sooner rather than later. It was a great night out on a Wednesday. Got the 16oz bone in Filet cooked a perfectly medium rare.  Hard to say what is the best Steak I've ever had at this point as I've had so many and this one ranks right up there with them.  The sweet potatoes were excellent and the side salad was perfect as well.  Girlfriend got the 7oz Filet and it was cooked perfect as well.  We split the crab cake that we added for $10.  That might be the only only thing I could pick on as it was in the really small side.  But it tasted really good.  We also split the creme brulee which was also really good.  Service was top notch.  Can't wait to go back. The pizza is amazing and the price is somehow even better...my friend and I got margherita pizzas for take out and they were less than $7 each for a perfect portion. Kind of in a weird spot downtown but that shouldn't take away from how good it was! Don't let the price lead you to think you're getting a low quality pizza. I'll definitely be back for take out again. A convenient, quick and delicious lunch option in the business district. Brick oven pizzas and super affordable prices will fill you up and leave a few slices for a second meal. The service is quick and the restaurant is very clean / well maintained. Took me three visits to Pittsburgh to finally get here and I really wish I had come sooner. The food and drink were fantastic. We both started with some craft beers and ordered some wings as an appetizer. The wings were perfectly cooked and the in house sauce was so good. Next we ordered a couple burgers and she switched a house special drink with bourbon while I stayed with some craft beers as I am not much of a bourbon drinker. I tried her drink and wished I had ordered it too as we we're getting close to having to leave. Do yourself a favor and tell the staff what your tastes are with alcohol and beer and let them surprise you. It's the mark of a great business. Good above the norm burgers.  Can't really think of anything remarkable to fill the review with, but is now on my list of regular go to spots downtown. Authentic food at a reasonable price!  People are extremely nice. I'll be coming back! This place doesn't look like much but I like it a lot and I come here pretty regularly. Hands down better than Madonna's! Best middle eastern food downtown for the price. Pretty good deal too. Try the lamb sheesh kebab, sleek, falafel, hummus. Everything is well seasoned, made with care and very flavorful. They have some good specials for their entrees too. Food was delicious and reasonably priced.  Only negative was that there was a language barrier since I don't speak Greek and they didn't have everything on their menu at lunchtime.  Now that I know the drill Id definitely come back. I was pleasantly surprised with this Arby's. I don't frequent downtown often, but I needed a quick snack. The restaurant has a modern feel with decoration. It was warm and inviting. \n\nI ordered from their value menu. I ordered a roast beef slider, vanilla milkshake, small fry, and slated caramel cookie. I went a little overboard but I love the milkshakes and cookies. \n\nThe food was prepared just as I expected and the service was quick. There is a bell located by the door so that you can acknowledge the staff for their good service. Many people rang the bell. I would recommend this location if you find yourself downtown and need a quick meal. Came in during first night downtown. They have a great selection of craft beers and drink specials. The food is kind of a second thought. We both ordered paninis which were good but nothing really special. I would give this place a second chance but I wouldn't go out of my way with all the other offerings in the area. Still hating this place. Due to Villa Reale's proximity to my work locale I find myself dining here more often then I would like to admit. The latest disaster lunch was an Italian sausage. The sausage was flavorless and dry to the point of being mummified. \nI have little else to add about how worthless this location is and I do wish that it would cease to exist. Absolutely delicious.  The young man and young woman that waited in us provided one of the better dink g experiences I've had in a long time.  This might be one of the better meals I've had in the Pittsburgh area...all in a styrofoam container!  Meal #1 couple meats, some rice and salad.  Gyro meat was excellent and truly authentic.  Meatballs are turkey and beef, very flavorful and tender.  And the chicken was awesome as well.  Salad basic middle eastern salad.  White sauce...excellent. Hot sauce even better.   You pick whether you got or cold side.  Shredded beet salad was great.  A nice bite to it.  Basic but flavorful olives...and on the house.  This was an absolute Mecca of goodness and all in a styrofoam container.  All of this was suggested and prepared by the young gentleman that waited in us.  The pita gyro might have been one of the best. The wrap, although flavorful was there simply to hold together an absolute mound of gyro meat.  Adding white sauce and the hot sauce made it all the better.  Tres lesche cake.  Best I've ever had!  And the young man brought us soup on the house.  So simple, yet surprisingly flavorful.  This is an absolute must for any foodie out there!  Best Middle Eastern food in Pittsburgh and Cleveland, two cities which boast some pretty good food.  Thank you for a wonderful dining experience, plastic fork and all. Went here tonight for dinner with my husband. I was impressed. I know Italian food very well and this was good Italian food. I was impressed with the sauce. Get the 'sauce and meatballs' side dish. It's really good. I've never been in a restaurant that had good red sauce that tastes homemade so I usually end up ordering a vodka cream sauce. Vodka sauces are hard to really mess up. I'm a sauce snob. Well, this place had a good red sauce. I got the ravioli for my entree which had a marinara sauce on it so can't really judge from that, Italians will know what I mean. But the sauce on my husband's spaghetti bolognese and the sauce and meatballs side dish was fantastic. Enough about sauce. Well done. \n\nUsually in an Italian restaurant since I don't order dishes with red sauce the place gets judged by me by the quality of their meatball.  Vallozzi's gets a B+ for their meatballs. \n\nWe were too full to order dessert -but they were tempting!  Oh and bonus our waitress was soooo super nice and friendly. Great customer service! Vallozzis in the heart of Downtown Pittsburgh is a great spot for business lunch and dinner. You can expect a decent wine selection, a well-sorted menu, and attentive service - exactly what you'd want from an upscale Italian restaurant. \n\nWhile I was mostly satisfied with the food - especially the burrata (soft and creamy, $13) and the Crab Cake ($39.95), other items didn't meet expectations, especially the Osso Buco ($44), which lacked taste and came on a risotto that was al dente.\n\nOur group was placed in a separate dining room without windows, not much atmosphere there. I recommend you to request the main dining room facing the street.\n\nOverall, I found the prices a bit outrageous for Pittsburgh (I'd expect that in San Francisco), and my experience didn't justify charging ~$80 for an appetizer, entree, and two drinks. A good friend recommended this place but I was a bit skeptical.  Needless to say, the food, service and environment was absolutely fantastic!  I'll be going back!  Our waitress, Gina, was incredible, we felt as if we were the only patrons in the restaurant, we weren't though.  Everyone was friendly and accommodating and made this experience amazing.  We had Pizza, pasta, salad and appetizers, all we're perfect, very flavorful and tasty! I highly recommend a visit to this fine establishment. This guy that I am dating took me here for New Year's Eve and it was my first time dining here! We made reservations a few days in advance and didn't have any trouble getting a table. \n\nFor starters our waitress Anna, was wonderful! She took great care of us. We ordered a bottle of Don Miguel Gascon Malbec. I have never tried Malbec before and I have to say I am a big fan. It went down smooth. We ordered the oysters rockefeller and crab cake for appetizers. I was pleasantly surprised with how much I liked the oysters. They were cooked with spinach, bacon, pernod, and hollandaise. The crab cake was also very delicious and was filled with plenty of crab. For our meals, I ordered the crab stuff shrimp with green beans and cheddar mashed potatoes and he ordered the ahi tuna with white rice. The shrimp was nice and meaty and the crab stuffing was appropriately portioned. I highly recommend this dish, along with the oysters rockefeller. They also have a rewards program that we were made aware of! It's $25 and each time you dine with them or any of their other restaurants (the list is a mile long) you earn points. Our next visit we get a free appetizer! This is definitely a great special occasion restaurant. The second time in a row I have gone there and had terrible service. The first time, I waited almost an hour for a $30 stuffed shrimp dinner.  When I got it, I couldn't wait any longer and asked them to pack it to go. It looked like dog food by the time I walked down the street to my home.  And it didn't taste much better. Everyone has a bad night, so I gave them another try.   This time for happy hour.... supposedly the #1 happy hour.  Granted, they have some great deals on their menu.  I waited 10 minutes to be offered a drink, when the bar was more than half empty, then after waiting 40 minutes for my cheeseburger, I decided to leave without it.    \n\nI won't be back. The delivery service was very slow and once received it was cold. I was excited due to the other comments and anticipated the good to be great. To my surprise the burger was the best and the pizza calzone was dry and not tasty at all. Will not be returning . Didn't smell like a food place when I walked in.  Like, i didn't smell ANY food.  I asked about the steak sandwhich and he couldn't even tell me anything of note about except that it was better than fast food.  We ordered anyway because it was late and didn't know what else was open.  I had to add salt and pepper to my sandwhich.  Eventually just threw it away when I was unsuccessful at adding any flavor whatso ever to the sandwhich.  I forgot what my wife oredered but she didn't finish it either. This place is really grown on me since they opened up their downtown location. Generally speaking, I've liked most of the things that Eton Park does but I like this one most of all. Their burgers are top notch! I love getting a bacon and cheese burger with their awesome eat N park ranch dressing. Definitely strong competition for best burger downtown. Their fries are awesome too. The service is really good and even if it's a long line moves pretty quickly. It's a great in and out joint for a quick burger. As I usually make a weekly trip to Pittsburgh, I am always on the look out for somewhere new to eat. This is always on my list of options. \n\nI absolutely love their \"Salads By You\". All the toppings you want for one price (minus some extras). The ingredients are always fresh and the staff is always happy and willing to help you if you have any questions or concerns. \n\nThe burgers are ok, nothing special (just your typical E'nP burger). Though, I really do enjoy the Mean Gran Avocado Turkey Burger. There's just something about the turkey burger, brioche bun, avocado and swiss cheese that do it for me.\n\nService is usually good, even during the lunch rush. They are usually pleasant and willing to help you with anything you need. This used to be one of my favorite restaurants, I would recommend it to everyone. I took a guest here for a special occasion and we had a horrible experience. My guest ordered the ravioli. Once the meal arrived, his plate consisted of 6 small ravioli. No side of veggies. We ended up sharing my meal. The waiter didn't recommend getting a side salad or cup of soup. We had no warning that the $30 plate was enough for a toddler. I was so embarrassed! I emailed the restaurant twice. I have yet to hear back from anyone about the experience. I will never go back nor will I recommend anyone to go there. If you have horrible customer service and don't try to make it right so that the customer will come back, I'm not interested. Hot dogs are cheap and delicious. The pizza puff is the real steal tho, flaky crust, sausage, cheese...it's like a gigantic gourmet version of a Torinos pizza roll but the size of a sandwich and for only like $2. Classic toppings, classic dogs, short wait, and friendly service!! Terrible Service, Took 15 minutes to get one burrito between lunch and dinner rush... They're burritos are mostly rice - easy way to save money - skimp on chicken and peppers and other such fixings. Honestly, it wasn't a terrible burrito for being 90% rice, but at the end of the day, as burritos go, a 90% rice burrito isn't great 1st timer and the place was completely empty. Tried the green curry noodles and a side of fried rice. The portions were health and both dishes were outstanding. More food than I could eat! I have no clue why I was the only one in the resturant as this place was awesome! I came here to meet up with someone back in November 2016. I was in town for haunt tour event. The evening I went, they were offering an amateur strip contest. I don't do clubs or bars all that much. It was never scene. \n\nI walked here since I parked at a nearby place for the tour. The place is like a basic alleyway between buildings. Nothing fancy, smoking inside is permitted, cash bar, and the place didn't feel all that clean inside. I think the smoke did it for me since I'm not a smoker. I saw the drag show and their performance was meh. Nothing great at all. I heard this place was great in the past, but is now a dump. \n\nI wouldn't come back here and I do not recommend coming here. Try to find another bar to go to if that is what you are looking for. I was not impressed. 1st time and last time I go.  Ordered a pizza and got a 20 min quote.  Sat in the place for over 45 mins just to find out my pizza was ready since I got there.  The place wasn't even busy.  Pizza was bland (and cold!).   Avoid this place. Oh how the mighty have fallen....\n\nSaturday night before a show, my husband and I return for appetizers. We get calamari, historically our favorite calamari ever, and nachos with chicken.  The calamari was no longer tossed with the delicious sauce, therefore I did it myself in the middle of the restaurant. Overall, still good calamari, but not the greatest.  However, the nachos, which are $11 plus an additional $5 for chicken, were awful.  They were tortilla chips with shredded cheese microwaved with tasteless \"pico\" some olives, sour cream and guacamole. The chicken tasted Like yesterday's leftovers thrown on top.  There was no saving these nachos.  Thankfully, our server took them off our bill. \n\nThe two of us have lots of fond memories at Olive or Twist, especially the night before our wedding.  However, after three consecutively bad trips to Olive or Twist, we are done. Been here twice and I was very pleased both times. It's a great place for before or after dinner drinks. Good martinis and cocktails. Downstairs can be crowded but there's a roomier, quieter lounge upstairs. A friend and I went here for dinner before the Symphony.  We both had the salmon and it was stellar.  I had it the last time I ate here and it was just as good as the first time. My friend felt the same.  Service was excellent, Laura, our server was pleasant and gave just the right amount of attention.  She came when needed, and left us to chat when not needed. No wait for the check \n\nThe cocktails were and deserts were delicious as well.  We shall definitely be going back. The milkshakes here are good but I can't say they're the best I had. I felt like my milkshake wasn't blended as well as it could be. They're also pretty expensive. It did have a ton of cookies in it though, which is always a good thing!\n\nThe service here was great and very fast.\n\nI think I would probably check out somewhere else before I'd come back again, but I would definitely give it another shot. Shockingly I've lived here for years and this was my first time ever trying the milkshake factory. It was exceptionally warm in the middle of January so I figured why not. I'm not sure what the south side location looks like but the downtown location is really nice. Everything looks super clean and it has a fairly large area of seating. \n\nAs for the milkshakes what can you really say besides they are delicious? Milkshakes are milkshakes and they are all delicious. I will say that they had some deluxe shakes that looked amazing. I will definitely be stop ping back in once spring rolls around! First time visit. I had the red cake which tasted exactly like red cake batter..very good. Daughter had chocolate chocolate which was yummy and very chocolatey. Husband had cookie dough and was disappointed. Said it was like ice mild with chocolate chunks. Very small cups for the price. Cute place and very clean. I had lunch here today with some people from my work.  The place is really nice on the inside and the service was great.  However my food is what earned this place a low review.  The burger I ordered was $15.  At that price, and at a place of this caliber, I expect the chef to know how to properly cook a burger.  I ordered my burger medium rare.  It was nowhere near that.  It was closer to well done and had no color or juices in the center.  Maybe burgers aren't their thing, but if that is the case then don't offer multiple burgers on your lunch menu and charge the high price. Questionable cleanliness, place feels dirty and just touching a ketchup bottle let's you know they never wipe them off, among other things for sure.  Not knocking them for being outdated, just overall cleanliness.   If you go, I suggest take out and bottle beverages.  The soda machine is suspect.\n\nThe food is usually decent the gyros, sauces and fries are delicious.  However they reheat previously cut gyro meat on the grill, maybe from precutting to much prior to lunch.  Personally I prefer the lamb \"meat\" fresh and sizzling off the spit.\n\nPayment, bring cash, no cards and the ATM is expensive and also not surprisingly... dirty.  \n\nI try to avoid this M&T's, but every once in a while I have a weak moment and end up with a gryo special, if I remember to bring cash.  Darn it, get a card reader. Spend your money somewhere else. The food is super salty and overpriced for what it is. Drinks take a long time to come, like 20 minutes. I've tried to like this place, really, but the last straw was the grouchy manager who was seemingly reprimanding a server on the floor? \n\nIn this wonderfully diverse and vibrant food city, there are a ton of great places to eat... check out some place else. I'm never ordering from them again. \nTonight I placed an order through the Order Up app from R&B's pizza. I received a phone call about an hour after my order that the driver was here, so I told him that I would come meet him outside. Instead of getting off the phone the man proceeds to explain that I'm not in the delivery area for them. Okay? So I told him that I ordered through an app...thinking how is this my fault? Doesn't stop there though, he continued to boldly and rudely remind me that they don't deliver to my area and next time my order will just be cancelled and not to order again. Fine by me, but I shouldn't have to get scolded about ordering from a restaurant when I placed the order through an online ordering food app!! That's ridiculous. I'm also mentioning this to Order Up especially when I thought it was their hired drivers that did the delivering? While I appreciate the new spin on made-to-order pizzas I do not appreciate unfriendly, ill-tempered, and unpleasant customer service from employees of this business. By no means am I saying that all V3 employees have displayed such disrespectful service towards patrons; however, it's takes one person to ruin it for all the others. During a recent visit I was shocked when an employee muttered something under her breath in response to a customer's request. It was said with such an attitude that it was rather off-putting. Needless to say, it spoiled my visit to V3 and made my pizza less enjoyable. \n\nI would rather draw attention to this occurrence as opposed to idly sitting by and letting that kind of service continue. So, I suggest that management train their employees on how be personable and respectful to customers. After all, the V3 experience is heavily dependent on customer and employee interactions. I've recently gone gluten free and I was glad to see that this place had gluten--free crust available. I tried it and didn't notice any difference in taste or feeling, which was nice. However, the customer in front of me in line got a regular crust and traditional red sauce. I saw them use the sauce ladle to spread the sauce on her crust and put it back into the sauce, then use the same ladle to spread the sauce on my gluten-free crust. This raises some cross-contamination issues - not a problem for me, but definitely dangerous for people with more serious health-related gluten-free diets.\n\nBut I do really like this place! They have so many options for sauce, cheese, and toppings! Pizzas are a flat rate, which allows you to put as many toppings as you want without worrying about crazy upcharges. They are a good size, I have ended up taking about 1/3 of my pizza home because it was too much, but I've also eaten the whole thing myself. My boyfriend and I have very different tastes, so we like that we can each get our own pizzas and make them exactly how we want them.\n\nThere is upstairs seating available, which I like because it is away from the counter. However, the lights were turned low - seemingly for an \"atmosphere\" reason. Maybe it's just me, but I like to be able to see my food when I eat, and it feels a little dark up there. \n\nExcited to see that they now have a Lawrenceville location too, much easier than driving downtown for me! I loveeee s'mores and I'm so happy that my husband works right near there! He always brings me home some great treats. My favorite is the chocolate peanut butter covered smores. Sooo good! Wish we had this in Texas! Not that great of a place to eat.  The salad wasn't too bad.  Chipped ham sandwich was nothing special and barely had any taste. Overall wouldn't recommend this place. So sad that we didn't get here until the Restaurant Week RIGHT before it's closing. We all enjoyed our meals and the service was great. Hope the owners open up another cool restaurant instead of putting in a chain. I've been here 3 times, and I absolutely enjoyed each of the visits! The dishes represent a nice blend of Chinese, Korean, and Japanese ingredients and flavors. My favorite is definitely the dandan noodles; I'm from the area in China where dandan noodles were originally invented, so I can tell you it's not authentic. But who cares! It's delicious!!! The dim sums are quite tasty as well. Last time my bf and I couldn't decide between pork belly bites and General Tso's cauli ower, so they let us have one on the house - such a nice gesture! I highly recommend this place and am definitely going back soon. :) Not good didn't like. The pork  belly was cold and unappetizing. Would not be back. Hard pass!! Great service, good food, but not overly amazing.\n\nI had the pork belly bites which were cooked perfectly but the mayo was a bit too much. Also had the duck confit with scallion pancakes, duck was a bit dry (which is hard to do with confit and also duck) but the scallion pancakes were delicious and tender but chewy. \n\nMy friend ordered the short rib which was very nicely cooked, but the sesame sauce was not that great and the cream cheese biscuits just seemed out of place. \n\nFor the price, I expected something a little more mind-blowing. Nice ambiance, nice staff, just not overwhelmingly good that I'd come back. Nice crowd gathering right after work, not too many items on there menu though. The food was really good, loved the dim lighting and overall atmosphere. Our waiter was very knowledgeable and on point with service. I would definitely go back for another meal How the mighty have fallen. It pains me to update this restaurant and downgrade its rating. I recommended this place to a friend recently and I probably won't do this any more.\n\nFor Christmas, I received a gift card here. It had been awhile since I've been back, so this was all the motivation I needed to get down there.\n\nThey remodeled Morton's about a year ago, and update the entire look. Everything is clean and modern, and it's simply a very nice place. Great ambiance, and definitely an impressive atmosphere. They have more seating now.\n\nThe service is also outstanding. Everyone we interacted with was friendly, personable, knowledgeable and didn't sound rehearsed or uninterested in the answers to their questions.\n\nThe chopped spinach salad and chilled seafood platter were both very good. The latter being served with mayo, horseradish, and cocktail sauce.\n\nThe Baked Apple Sour was delicious, although some patrons have said it was too sweet. I could drink those all night!\n\nThere are two major problems with this restaurant. The first is that the steaks are simply not seasoned enough. This was exactly the problem last time. My wife's filet simply had no wow factor. My 16oz Cajun Ribeye, while trimmed perfectly, just had no flavor. I couldn't taste anything even close to Cajun. I also couldn't taste salt and pepper. It doesn't help that both steaks were overcooked, which seems a rarity in the steakhouse industry. I've been served many steaks UNDER but very few over.\n\nThis leads me to problem number two, the check, and this is simply where I have the largest issue. You can do better on your steaks AND better on your wallet by simply going someplace else. There are so many steakhouses spitting distance from Morton's in Pittsburgh: Capital Grille, Ruths Chris, and Eddie Merlots. For a full meal at Morton's, including a couple drinks a piece, you are looking at a solid $200 per person -- and I think that money is better off spent elsewhere. I'm not adverse to expensive meals --- but they better wow me. A couple of bland overdone steaks is simply not going to do the trick!\n\nFor what it's worth, we tried getting a reservation at Capital Grille for the same night, but they were fully booked, but Morton's had plenty of room. I'm sure Morton's seat twice as many people, but it looked relatively empty 6-8pm on a Saturday. You've got to ask yourself, \"Why are people going to CG instead?\" My wife and I were in town from California visiting Pittsburgh for the Steelers game.  We were craving a steak and having had a phenomenal experience in Los Angeles at another Morton's Steakhouse, we decided to give this one a try.  \nWhen we got there, the restaurant was packed and only room in the bar area.  We took it.  Our waitress was very nice, attentive and explained all the specials.  We went with the appetizer tacos (AWESOME!!), and shared a ribeye (we always do) and a baked potato.  We ordered the steak medium well.  Well, it came almost well done, but we were so hungry we ate it.  Needless to say, it was very dry and not much flavor. For the price we paid for the steak, we could have just had two beers and two orders of the tacos and we would have been good to go. \nSo, for a Morton's Steakhouse, we expected more.  We were eye balling other steak venues in town too, but this one was the closest to our hotel. They had an extensive whiskey menu, and my boyfriend tried several good Bourbons.  He liked that the selection was on an iPad, and he could systematically choose his drinks.  He enjoyed the pork belly appetizer and beef tongue ravioli with a cream sauce  The food was tasty, but very rich.  I was a bit less of a fan only because I am less of a meat person, but that is only my particular taste.  4 stars based on my boyfriend's opinion. This place rocks. If you're really into great whiskey, burbon, and/or scotch, this is the place to go in pittsburgh, hands down. There is a wide variety of choices for novice enjoyment of different mash and there is also some stuff for those drinkers who like their burbon hot!!!! Plus, the food is fabulous. My favorite is the scallop dish that incorporates risotto with lemon zest, perfect. Fantastic !!loved the marrow and beef tartare \n\nLamb entree was delicious \n\nEverything was seasoned fantastic Amazing food. Great service with a sense of humor. Ask for Jenna. Get the scallops, mussels and foie gras. Interior is nice mix of urban hip and country chic. Burgers were expensive but worth the price. Drink menu was extensive, service was friendly and attentive.  One person in party had dry burger but overall we were impressed by our first visit here. This place is out of this world. The pig candy is like something that went straight from heaven to the plate. Love it love it love it love it!!! A group of four of us enjoyed a pretty tasty early dinner this past November. This place is popular, so we had to make the reservation on the early side. It was for sure full when we got there. \n\nIt was a weird but interesting place for a date night, what with the velvet walls and taxidermy theme stuff. The playlist was funky and enjoyable, if a little loud. We had a good time. \n\nTo start, we had the cheese board ($16), rusted duck brodo ($10) and the cauliflower with roasted farro, romanesco, baby carrots, pine nuts, brown butter, and harissa yogurt ($10). The brodo was a bit over salted for my tastes, though my husband was happy with it. I was a really big fan of the cauliflower--the farro gave it a really nice earthiness and the harissa yogurt a nice kick. \n\nThe men at the table also shared the pig candy ($8, pork belly, apple kimchi, miso caramel, and cilantro), which they were for sure into. \n\nFor our entrees, two of us got the scallops over risotto, a different iteration than they have now, but similar, with a chard over it instead of being paired with asparagus. The scallops were cooked extremely well and melted in my mouth in just the right way. My husband had the pan seared halibut with greens, almonds, and a green drizzle ($29) and cleaned his plate, though agreeing that it, too, was a bit on the salty side. Our friend's husband got the roasted chicken ($26) and gave it his hearty approval. \n\nCocktail-wise, everyone was very happy. All were tasty and well-balanced. I had the \"ether\" \u00a0(gin + cucumber + something else), and my boo had something equally tasty with an egg white on top.\n\nAt dessert time, we got a pumpkin pie that was not really what we expected -- more like a mini pot pie than a slice of pie. It was't so great, but maybe mostly just because it didn't live up to expectations. I was in no way into the crust. \n\nOverall, it was a nice place to share a meal with friends, but it definitely didn't blow my mind. What a fun and delicious experience! Of the items we tried, there was not a single miss. Favorite dishes: Crispy Pig Wing, Dry Aged Tartare, Rabbit & Dumplings, and Dirty Pasta. The nauti-mule cocktail was equally satisfying. I'll be sure to return to here when I'm next in the 'burgh! Visited with my girlfriend for restaurants week. Had an excellent meal and service. I'm glad they took part in this event. The meals they chose were varied and well made. I  look forward to a return trip for some of their staple menu items. We went here for restaurant week.  I order a cold soup, which was probably the best dish I had that night.  The wait for the food was a little long.  OK, but not the best restaurant on the street. I'll start by saying I'm not a regular fine-diner, per se, so my opinion may be due to that factor. My family and I went here for a belated Christmas celebration before a show at the Benedum, which is just a few blocks away. We knew from perusing the menu online that they served mostly small plates, so between the six of us, we shared two appetizers (papas fritas and braised brussels) and all ordered our food with various wines, beers, and martinis. The drink bill alone was quite pricey, but I guess that's expected at a fancier place. \n\nI got the blackened salmon and it was quite good, actually. It came with some sort of carrot and sweet potato mash, I think honey was also involved. My fianc\u00e9e got the beef tip ravioli and to our surprise, it was one large ravioli like we'd never seen before. He also enjoyed it, but it came with nothing but some green garnish and the one big ravioli wasn't what he was expecting. My dad got the scallops and Mexican street corn. The scallops were wrapped in chicken skin and there were just two. They were a decent size so that you had to cut them, and the chicken skin made doing so hard. The street corn was okay but since corn on the cob is typically seasonal, I was surprised they served that in December. He said he could tell it wasn't fresh. My mom got the Amish chicken meal and enjoyed it. My brother and sister-in-law both got the sirloin tornados. They came with two small mounds of mashed potatoes. My sister-in-law liked it well enough but my brother said they were nothing to rave about. He was also done with his entire plate before most of us were even half done, so he was clearly wanting more. In general, I didn't really like not knowing what side, if any, came with the meals. The carrot/sweet potato medley was a surprise and luckily, I like both. My mom's came with asparagus, but none of this is clearly listed on the menu so you don't really know what to expect. \n\nWhen we ordered, the waitress did kind of hint that we should've ordered more food, asking a few separate times if we wanted any other appetizers or side salads. Though I think we all would have liked more food, we knew we weren't going to get much more for another $10 a pop. The final tab was pretty high in comparison to other nice establishments we've gone to for special occasions where we left feeling more satisfied. \n\nThe wait staff was very nice and accommodating and the place itself had a pleasant atmosphere, though it was a bit dark to see the menu for my parents haha. All in all, we were mostly satisfied with the quality of the food itself but some aspects of the meals were unknown when we ordered and nothing was amazing or even really above average.  Its not the kind of place to go in a large group for dinner, in my opinion. Better for a night cap or something along those lines, if you're into that sort of thing. I'm not impressed. \n\nWhen entering the Fairmont, the bar is all the way in the back of the lobby. There are steps up to the bar but otherwise, the bar is not really separate from the lobby. A few tables were scattered around the bar and the atmosphere and decor were nice: very modern. Despite this fancy-hotel-bar-feel, the drinks and service did not impress me. Drinks were expensive and the signature cocktails I've tried weren't memorable. Additionally, the service my table received made the experience even less enjoyable. Our server had something smart to say after everything. Maybe this was just his personality, but this kind of attitude just didn't make a guest feel welcomed. I didn't really appreciate a sarcastic and smart aleck server when I was paying nearly $15 for my drink. \n\nI try to avoid Andy's but unfortunately, it's close proximity to my office means that I'll probably return for happy hour in the future. Hopefully my next experience will be better. After lunch, I wanted to grab some fresh coffee at a non-chain business. I struck gold here with their coffee. I was in town for the Legendary Haunt Tour back in November 2016. This small business was highly satisfying in my opinion. \n\nI never been to a coffee shop like this business. You can purchase whole bean coffee from various locations in the world. It felt like a Teavana store, but with coffee. I made it just in time because the coffee bar was closing in a few minutes. I ordered the coffee of the day. I forgot what it is, but it tasted great. The Barista was very nice and professional. The shop offers a lot of wonderful things rather than just coffee. I was very pleased with my visit to the store. If I had to the purchase more, I would have purchased a lot different coffee beans. I didn't know how well that would work on my flight home. \n\nI would highly recommend stopping in here for coffee over Starbucks. Stop in the learn about all the neat products in this shop. Thank you. It's so hard for me to get here before it closes :( since I bought my French press I've been testing out various coffee beans. I believe they can grind them for you if you want. This place is great for different blends of coffee. The hardest part is figuring out what you want because they don't have samples of everything. \n\nMy personal favorite is the northern Italian. It's deliciousness in coffee form. \n\nMost of the people working there know their coffee so you can ask them for recommendations or advice. I have been coming to this store for several years now, and it has never produced a delightful experience.  If you are in a rush, this checkout line will not be favorable to you.  That is the nicest thing I can possibly say here. What a disappointing meal. I never thought that a restaurant that features a display case of fish could fail at the preparation of seafood. Both my appetizer and whole fish were beyond well done; rubbery octopus and dried lavraki. Try the potato, it was the best part of the meal. Service started great but fizzled to a flop. I had a salad that was excellent. The salad with cucumber, tomato and feta. Also had the sea bass and it was below room temperature and not cooked long enough. The rice was also cold and there wasn't very much of it. Also had a martini and there was barely anything in the glass. \n\nIt was an adult night out for me and my wife and we were put in a back room with a family with small children. Unbelievable and unacceptable. Will never come back to this restaurant.  This is not a place for small children. I've eaten here a couple times and the atmosphere is nice and the interior of the restaurant seems clean. Service when we went both times pretty quick and the servers were nice. \n\nI am not a major fan of this type of food as it turns out which is disappointing so I'm probably not the best judge of that. That being said, I do like shrimp and grits which I tried here. I thought the grits were a little bland but it was otherwise okay and I would give it another shot if I came: Also, I have had their flatbreads which I did really like and would try again. I'd recommend it to anywhere coming if you don't really like creole. I have had better food in the real NOLA though of course but this isn't bad. \n\nEverything here seemed sort of average to me so while I'd come back if someone else wanted to but wouldn't pick it myself. Very good pizza with great convenient hours (seems like always open haha) but quality pizza with good service. Also very fast! I ordered and they told me 45 minutes. I didn't mind waiting. Came in 25 minutes. But when took to my room, the wrap was ice cold. Don't understand how that could happen when they delivered from only .5 miles away. Very very disappointed. I visited the Brassero Grill food truck after a Beer + Yoga event at The Brew Gentleman on a Sunday afternoon. I had been meaning to try their food and was excited to see them at the brewery. I was accompanied by my mom and aunt, who are both not a fan of spicy food and the nice gentlemen at Brassero Grill were more than happy to accommodate them. My mom had a veggie quesadilla, I had one as well and my aunt had a deconstructed burrito. The food was SO fresh. I loved the guacamole- it was very fresh with lots of lime and red onion in it. My mom and aunt loved their food as well. I am excited to come back - they told me they are at the Brew Gentleman every Thursday (I believe) so I am def planning on coming back ASAP. Loved this place! I was super hesitant because it's located Downtown and to me, that means that my first thought is \"over priced\". But no. This place was pretty sweet. We sat in the downstairs area, near the awesome mural on the wall of the last supper but with skeletons. Our server was wonderful and attentive to our large party for the evening. To start, we had the queso and OMG was the queso amazing. SO much flavor - we loved it. They had PBR in boots on special and $5 shots of tequila (I forget the brand, but I know it was not bottom shelf). The tacos are small- like two bites each, but they have a ton of flavor. I ordered the pollo rojo (braised chicken, smoky guajillo chili salsa, queso fresco, white onion, chipotle lime crema, cilantro) and the mole (oaxacan style braised chicken, pickled red onion, queso fresco, cilantro) tacos- both were wonderful. My boyfriend ordered the pork belly one and loved it. I also ordered the milanesa which is classified as a torta and was UNbelievable.It was a chicken cutlet, black beans, salsa verde, arugula, avocado lemon mayo on a telera roll. DELICIOUS. This place is awesome, great service, very affordable and super tasty. Check it out, now. I've been here several times and I think I want to like it way more than I actually do. Cool bar atmosphere with an additional bar and table seating downstairs. Servers have been knowledgeable and fun. The atmosphere is fun but relaxed and can be intimate if you are seated in a good places, although, it can be loud at times and hard to have a conversation.  Prices are average/moderate. \n\nI have had a few tasty drinks here including a spicy jalape\u00f1o margarita and a watermelon margarita. Both were delightful and I would come back for this! I only ordered food once. I thought the tacos would be a good choice considering it's a pretty standard staple to get at any Mexican restaurant but I was sadly disappointed. The tacos were served cold. The mole taco was bland but the fish taco flavorful and delicious despite it being cold. The queso had a weird texture to me and not like other queso dips I have had but my husband actually liked it.\n\nI'd be willing to come back and try food again if someone wanted to but I'm more likely to come for another fun margarita! The server was fantastic today. I was with a few people who hadn't been there before and she welcomed us and did a great job explaining the menu. The guacamole and chips and a cold beer started our happy hour off right! We were able to secure one of the bar tables since we arrived a little before the happy hour crowd (4:30pm). The place did fill up over the course of the night, so it's clear Bakersfield isn't disappointing!\n\nI have been to this location previously and also had good experiences. Everyone I was with really enjoyed the spicy jalapeno margaritas (I'm not a fan of spice), but they all loved them - so give them a try if you are in to spice! When I had the tacos before there was a good variety and the flavor of the chicken was delicious. Found Bakersfield after Steelers game. Best margaritas ever. Everything homemade. Manager is friendly and mingled with the patrons to make sure everything was to their satisfaction!  Great food, drinks and atmosphere. Will definitely be back soon. Give it a try. You'll have a wonderful time!! The tacos here are awesome. I have loved everyone I tried except for the vegetarian option, but only because it was too spicy for me. The house margarita is great, and not super expensive. If you are going with a large group, I would suggest the group dinner special where you get guac, salsa, queso, salad, and a TON of tacos. It's a great way to try something you might not necessarily order on your own, and you will not leave hungry. Best tacos in this area! Seriously, guys. Go. Reasonably priced and a good selection. Do yourself a favor and get the fish taco! I used to work here and I still go for the food and drinks. Amazing damn margs, lemon and lime squeezed fresh, no fake crap tasting juice. And the tacos are to die for. It's very inexpensive as well so you're not going to break the bank going there!!!!! Picture it: A cold Sunday afternoon, lunch with a foodie Manhattanie friend I haven't seen in ages; we want a restaurant, we want it to be good, we want it to be close to his hotel because it's 15 degrees out, and we want it to be open, because it's Sunday and we're downtown. Yelp told me the whole block was good, so I was open to whatever worked out. But let's face it. I was born in San Diego and I'm always chasing tacos, so I wasn't disappointed when this was the first place whose doors were unlocked.\n\nWe were seated promptly and the host was knowledgeable but not overbearing about drink possibilities. In the end we went with fresh-squeezed lemonade because we weren't in an alcoholic mood, and that was a good call even in the middle of winter. Who does not want fresh-squeezed lemonade? Why don't I freshly squeeze my lemons? (I'm lazy, that's why, but I may have to be less lazy because it was really delicious.)\n\nWe started with guac, chips, and queso. Friends, the queso comes with that lovely crust on it, you know what I'm talking about, like the cheese that hits the pan when you're making grilled cheese and it's the best. There's a reason they serve it with a spoon. The guacamole is fresh and chunky. None of that smoothly processed nonsense.\n\nWe also got a variety of tacos, on homemade tortillas. There's another thing I wish I wasn't too lazy to make. Tortillas are not just a taco delivery device, friends. They are for tastiness. My designated tacos were the chicken mole and the hongos (mushrooms). Not too spicy, but that chicken, wow, so delicious. Presentation was delightful and the filling-to-tortilla ratio is such that you may lose a bite (or lend a bite to your dining companion before eating the taco, this is a better plan, just sayin) but overall you're getting a decent amount of innards without being left eating several bites of tasty tortilla.\n\nThe service was good, timely (except you should obviously expect your FRESH squeezed lemonade to take a bit of time because they are squeezing lemons and that takes a hot minute), attentive but not up your nose. Note that we were in there on a Sunday during a football game so it was only about 1/3-1/2 full, which is my preferred fullness of restaurant. Put this on my \"A+ would taco again\" list. It's just as good as Tako. The prices are very reasonable. The margaritas are served in a mason jar. I like that. The guacamole is very fresh and has nice chunks of avocado. The server puts two sauce bottles on the table, house made, one is a cilantro sauce and one is a smokey sauce. These sauces rock, I want to drink them. We had tacos and a salad. I was a little disappointed that my salad had home fries in it, I was trying to be a bit on the healthy side, but it was good. I don't know about that fry thing on a salad Pittsburgh, I am from Maine and I want my salad to be a bit on the fresh from the garden side. Love this place. Love Pittsburgh. Love my husband. Absolutely loved the tacos. Went here during lunch and there was no rush. If you try anything out on Penn Ave, stop here! Today I decided to give Bakersfield another try with my coworker in tow. We arrived promptly at noon and were greeted by a pleasant woman behind the hostess station. The restaurant itself wasn't quite crowded yet, which I attribute to the fact it was below zero outside because it definitely picked up during our meal. After we sat down, we were greeted by a perky waiter named Chris. He was upbeat and attentive to our needs. He also didn't disappear for long periods of time like the waitress I had during my prior visit. \n\nSince we had a little bit of time, we opted to give the queso a second chance and I'm sure glad we did. It came out hot and had a gooey coating that melted and moved just as cheese should. It was quite glorious. Chris recommended a few items from the menu and my coworker actually selected Chris's favorite, the Milanesa, a chicken cutlet on a telera roll. The portion size was generous and the lime accented the dish in a creative way. I decided to try three different tacos. I ordered the bistec taco, the cochinita pibil, and the pork belly. The meat was cooked on the well side for the steak, which was fine because it wasn't overdone. The only thing I didn't enjoy about this one was some of the cabbage slaw was a bit too tough. The cochinita was spicy, but not so much so that I needed to gulp massive amounts of water. It also had pickled onions which were delicious and added a bit of sourness to the taco. Finally, the pork belly was something completely foreign, but made sense. I've never had pork belly before, so I don't really know how it should have been cooked, but I really liked the flavor profile when combined with the juicy pineapple. It was so savory! \n\nOverall, I'm glad I decided to come back to Bakersfield. I was impressed by our diligent and personable waiter and really enjoyed the creative twist and flavor profile of the tacos I ordered. Additionally, my coworker's fianc\u00e9 loves tacos and he found a new place to bing her! We love it here. The tacos and sauces are delicious. Only one out of 10 times were we disappointed, so we did not deduct a star. On that occasion, the waitress forgot about us, and only a few tables were full, and additionally, she forgot to bring the replacement taco when the order was wrong, and did not modify an overcharge on our check. Every other visit, food was made in a timely manner, and we always enjoy it! Had a delicious late dinner at Bakersfield after driving all day from northern Michigan. We had five different tacos, all of which were good, and two drinks each. The spicy margaritas are terrific. My friend and I came in late, starving - and thankfully they were open!\n\n*Their kitchen is open late*\n\nWe both ordered some tacos and a few drinks, they had a special deal on their tequila shots so of course we had to partake. \n\nI had a beer, modelo, and my friend had a margarita.  The beer was good, and the margarita was also pretty good. \n\nThe tacos were AMAZING.  They were absolutely delicious. \n\nAnd the atmosphere was great.  Very relaxing, very laid back, and very comfortable. \nI would definitely come back.\n\nAlso our server was great! Very attentive, and very friendly.  \n\nIf I'm ever back in Pittsburgh, I'm coming back here :) So good!! Great service and very accommodating. I got the hongos taco and the huitlacoche taco, made vegan and they were fantastic! Full a flavor and fairly authentic. Needed some tasty food to fuel up on a sub-arctic night before the Steelers playoff game and Bakersfield was a winner.  Also have the mightiest bourbon menu I've seen in the entire state.\n\n\nPacked house but they got us in fast and the taquitos were outrageously flavorful.  We had 5 different ones and can recommend each heartily:\n-Fish\n-Beef\n-Pork\n-Mole\n-Pollo Rojo\n\nMad props as well to our excellent server Ashley--wonderful service and true bourbon expertise. We decided to celebrate New Year's Eve with a great meal, and Bakersfield did not disappoint! The whiskey and tequila selection was impressive, but we started with a pitcher of the Bakersfield Margaritas ($32). Absolutely delicious with limes squeezed fresh for each order. The Chips and Queso appetizer ($6) with chorizo (+ $1) was a nice surprise. It was placed in a cast iron skillet and baked in the oven before serving. I ordered the Short Rib Tostada ($9) as my main course. The short rib was seasoned well and very tender, and anything with a fried egg on top is a winner in my book. My buddy ordered the Short Rib Torta ($10) and almost licked his plate clean. We felt like this was a killer value with a combined total tab, including tax, of only $62. Best Mexican food I've eaten in a long time. There wasn't a drop of margarita or a bite of food left at the end of our meal. The service was attentive, energetic, and incredibly friendly. We could not have asked for a better experience. Zero complaints. Bakersfield is the best taco joint in the city. Most importantly, they are open for lunch. Who doesn't NEED tacos for lunch?\n\nThe staff are super friendly and adorable. Seriously everyone there was great! From the super attentive waitstaff to the owners that sometimes will walk around and tell the Bakersfield story (Ask- get cultured on Bakersfield,CA culture!) everyone seems to like their job. \n\nI have been here so many times and I have one suggestion that you shouldn't pass up. Whether it's lunch or dinner or late night you have to try their margarita! They have 2 versions, the premium made with top shelf vodka or the Bakersfield. Whatever you choose doesn't matter because the key to the amazing margs is that they have magic elves juicing fresh limes in the basement. Nothing else can explain why I've become completely obsessed.\n\nI don't even need to mention the tacos. Just remember that 2 tacos are a perfect portion and don't forget the quac. I was here with my good friend to get some coffee since it was freezing. This review is based on visit back in November 2016. The location was easy to find. We walked from a nearby hotel in the area. Prices were reasonable, interior was clean, very friendly Baristas, and I experienced no problems here. \n\nThis place was busy, but the service was efficient. I just ordered a Venti coffee to keep me warm. For some reason, it took a long time to make my basic coffee. I don't know if they were brewing fresh coffee or someone forgot my order. It was a little frustrating. Besides that mishap, I enjoyed this Starbucks. I would recommend coming here for that tasteful Starbucks treat. You get your money's worth. The meat on the sub is also really fresh and so are all the other ingredients. If you need something to eat and don't mind spending a bit extra for superior quality, then you should go here. The place has ample seating and the people that work there are pretty nice. This is one of those occasions when I wish that I could add additional stars on top of the already awarded 5 star reviews.  Madonna's is beyond delicious. I not only love the roasted chicken I fiend for the roasted chicken. So supple is that leg and thigh that falls away from the bone. Always great and cheerful service and always delicious eats! Great downtown lunch spot. I've had a bunch of different dishes here and they are all delicious!\n\nI've had the chicken, beef, lamb and most of the sides--never disappointed! I typically stop in for lunch and it's easy to get in and out and on your way. \n\nThe staff is always SO friendly, which is such a game-changer for me. I came here twice: once when I ordered from the happy hour menu, and once when I ordered from the ceviche menu.  Happy hour was fun, and we ordered quite a bit of food for a reasonable price.  However, the seviche menu was rather expensive.  It was a date night, so we splurged and ordered the pricey plates--they were yummy, but our bill was on the high side.  Fire and Ice was probably my favorite. I have been here both for happy hour and for dinner, and the service, food, and drinks were all amazing both times. The happy hour is Monday-Saturday 4:30-6:30PM (see menu in picture below). I tried a mango mojito for $5, and it was honestly best mojito I've ever had! I have also tried their aloe spritzer and the free sangria from Yelp check-in, and I have really, really liked all of their drinks. I don't particularly like the taste of alcohol so I think their drinks are perfect for me because they weren't super alcoholic so they basically just tasted sweet. For food, I have tried the seviche and mussels and both were delicious and came quickly. \n\nThe restaurant/bar usually isn't too crowded on weeknights so I would definitely recommend going then. The only downside to Seviche is that it is on the pricier side, so try it out for happy hour first if you're not sure if you'll like it! Came here Saturday night while in town for church, a.k.a. Hot Mass. Drawn by Latin cuisine and a free sangria upon check-in from the Yelp app, we walked in and, seeing no host, no host stand, and no sign saying \"please wait to be seated\", made our way to a table in the back. A server approached and asked if someone sat us. I said \"no, ...\" along with all the stuff I just typed out in the preceding sentence. He said no problem, but went to retrieve menus for us.Upon his return, he waited patiently while we obtained and presented our check-in offers. \n\nMy compadre had never had ceviche, the national dish of many a Latin American country, and perhaps the honorary dish of South America as a whole. Seviche offered a handful of interpretations available with a modest selection of different seafood options, from standards like tuna and salmon, to cobia, and yellowtail. We ordered the fire + ice and the beet + orange with tuna and yellowtail. \n\nBefore the ceviche even arrived, we were talked into some empanadas and pan con chihuahua. When the ceviche did arrive, we dove right in. The fire and ice ceviche is served as six shooters, so we toasted our trip and downed the first of three. It was delicious. Really satisfying. Being the signature dish, it was going to be hard to match, and the beet and orange was great in its own right, but definitely didn't surpass the first. \n\nNot soon after, the tapas made their way to the table. I opted to try the pan first, while my travel companion sampled the empanada. The pan con chihuahua ended up being my favorite dish of the night. the pork belly and pepper puree were exquisite, and the cheese didn't hurt either. I wished I had one or two more, but settled on my empanada instead. Having ran out of pork empanadas earlier in the night, the kitchen was serving up a chicken empanada instead. I was not disappointed, but do wish I had saved that pork belly for last. Now I know better for next time. Good for breakfast. I had the egg and cheese sandwich with pesto. They let you pick the toppings you want on it. It was tasty. Service is slow, though. And they didn't have smoothie ingredients that day. Definitely a spot to check out when looking for a quality sandwich at a reasonable price.\n\nThe shop staff are very friendly and more than willing to accommodate any request. \n\nDo yourself a favor and get one of the steak sandwiches off of the menu. They are amazing. The ultra is my favorite.\n\nAlso the Cancun fries are awesome. 1 order is for sue big enough to serve 2 people maybe even 3! \n\nThis is one of the Peppis that takes credit cards as well. Not all do FYI First things first, those drinks were so good. Service was great and the overall ambiance is well designed. The food was good in general (ordered jerk chicken tacos and octopus escabeche), although the chicken tacos didn't have crispy enough chicken and the octopus was not as fresh as I would have hoped. Now back to the drinks. The bartender was very helpful and cute. Ordered the walking dead cocktail (delicious) and also an off-menu espresso martini with rum that was really, really well made, deliciously full bodied and rich. Seriously, I want more... but til next time. Definitely would like to come back here again for a happy hour. The interior of the restaurant is very cool.  My husband and I had dinner there on Saturday night.  The drinks were ok, and the food was just ok.  We ordered the Mexican street corn and macaroni and cheese as appetizers.  They were the best part of the meal.  \n\nFor our entrees, we got the jerk grouper (special) and the shrimp with polenta.  The fish was delicious, although the slaw it was served with was average.  Our waiter recommended the shrimp dish, and it was very disappointing.  There were a few shrimp, a large serving of polenta, and it was all covered with a tomato sauce that did not have much flavor. Excellent food! If you get the tacos I recommend getting a side as well because although delicious they are not very large. Well my Yelp friends, Yelp led me to Pirata and it didn't disappoint! The food had good flavor and it is unique to what else you can find downtown. Arriving at 11:45 for a Friday lunch was great timing as only a few other tables had been taken at that point. The staff was incredibly friendly and were ready to answer questions and make suggestions.\n\nThere were three of us, and we decided to try the Cuban Sandwich Bites (app), each had an Empanada, and then we shared the Mac & Cheese and the sweet plantains. Hands down, the Empanadas took the prize. These things were delicious, meaty, pockets of YUM! Each one is $3 and there are two beef flavors and one chicken. The man who delivered the food offered hot sauce, and yes! I added that to the salsa that comes with it for a great tasting, spicy treat. \n\nI knew from another review that the mac & cheese had a nutmeg flavor to it. It was good, but as the three of us discussed, we think we'd probably want to focus on other things before trying it again. Both people I dined with liked the cuban bites quite a bit - but we were all surprised that they came out looking more like egg rolls (check out my picture to see) but were still very good! I'm not a big honey mustard fan, but it didn't deter me from trying, and I'd try them again.\n\nAlthough we all agreed we were full from the dishes the waitress mentioned the bread pudding for dessert, and I just couldn't pass it up. Bananas, walnuts... sounded like magic. Unfortunately this was our least favorite part. While the dish and the outer ring of the dessert was \"scalding hot\" as the waitress warned us - the center of the dessert was very cold. Some of the crust had a burnt taste to it as well, so while I\"m hoping it was a fluke, I don't think I'd spend the money again to find out. As I mentioned, the service was very friendly but at times felt slow, so rushed lunchers may want to wait until you have some buffer time just in case it is busy. Came here on recommendation of a friend. It feels cool to be checking out a place when it's still new. It's in a bit of a rundown/creepy area of downtown but the interior is really nice. Made me feel like I was on a Caribbean cruise except more sophisticated. \n\nOur waiter was nice and pretty attentive. It was empty-ish for a Friday night (albeit it was 7pm and sooo cold that night). I really appreciated the easy online reservations and the text reminders. The ability to text if I was running late was another really great added bonus.\n\nWe got the Jamaican beef patties - they were delicious. Lots of cumin flavor which reminds me of Indian food. In fact, the menu has a lot of Indian influences like rotis and chutneys. \n\nWe shared the Cubano sandwich and a side of rice and beans. Of note, you can't sub out the fries on the Cubano which is a bummer. The rice was delicious though :) Easily made reservations for a Saturday at 6:30 for a party of 4. Automated text messages the day and a half an hour before to confirm/remind reservation time. \n\nArrived early, our table was ready but we asked to sit at the bar for a while to wait for our friends/grab a drink. Nice drink menu! Lots of rum, cocktails, wine and beer selections. Among our group we had the Mojito Royals, Mutiny on the Bounty, the Caribbean Julep and the house red. Everything was great - but the Caribbean Julep was overloaded with ice and was difficult to drink. \n\nAfter a drink we decided to go to our table, where we waited probably 10 minutes for our waitress to arrive. Not a huge deal, but we didn't have drinks (water or alcoholic) so it was a bit annoying. When she did arrive she was pleasant and helpful. We ordered drinks (just the house red/white) and the Cuban Sandwich Bites and Pineapple Guacamole for starters. Loved them!\n\nEach couple shared two varieties of the Caribbean Rotis: pork belly and jerk chicken. Warning! The jerk chicken is spicy. You get to taco-like tortillas with each order and it's convenient for sharing. The pork belly was awesome with the mashed plantains. We also got an order of the Jamaican street corn (off the cob in a crock) and it was AMAZING. Along with the tostones and sweet plantains we loved our food. \n\nI would have no problem returning or recommending this restaurant to a friend. Definitely a good spot to meet with friends for drinks/small bites or a meal for date night. 4 stars for slower service after seating and an overload of ice in the julep. Amazing first experience at Pirata! I stopped in for a quick lunch and I was not disappointed with a single thing we ordered off the menu. We started with the malangas fritters for our appetizer - so delicious! You get four fried malanga balls that are paired with a garlic aioli dipping sauce. Deep fried then covered in more fat - nothing sounds more delicious yet fatal than that. For my entr\u00e9e, I went with the kale & arugula salad which comes in a very good portion size. The burnt honey vinaigrette was delicious yet light. It is topped with pickled watermelon (a little weird), pumpkin seeds, and goat cheese. My only complaint would be the pumpkin seeds which were way too tough to even bite. I had to hand pick them out of my salad before I choked on one of them. We also ordered the papas fritas and sweet plantains for sides. They also come in very generous portion sizes. The fries came with Jamaican ketchup which, dare I say, I actually liked more than the regular ketchup (I'm sorry all you Heinz lovers). For the end of the meal, the sweet plantains served as a nice (healthy-ish) dessert alternative.\n\nService was good throughout the entire meal. Everyone was very friendly and since the restaurant was slow during our visit, service was prompt and all our food came out quickly. Highly recommend Pirata for anyone looking to test out some unique cuisine downtown! Loved the food, loved the selection of rums, and adored the tiki glasses that the frozen drinks came in. The jerk chicken was tender, and the collards were spicy but not too spicy.\n\nThe service was good, but slow, so I'm giving it a 4 instead of a 5. I will be back again! J and I came here for a late lunch/early dinner today after seeing a play. I am always skeptical about Caribbean food, as my family is Caribbean and I have high expectations. I'll start with the Pros: the decor was very pretty. Nice murals, bar top, and stools. We sat at the bar to watch the Steeler's game while we ate our food and spoke to the bartender who was very friendly. The prices for the food were fairly decent. I got the Caribbean crab cakes to start and the sea bassa sandwich with tomatoes, spicy mayo, arugula, and spicy ketchup. J ordered the jerk chicken and subbed the rice and beans for fries. Everything was around $40. Now the cons: despite the food sounding tasty, it actually wasn't. There was a major emphasis on spicy that it masked the flavor of everything we ate. I couldn't tell you what my fish tasted like, and J described his jerk chicken as \"spicy sawdust\". Plus, my fish sandwich was way too messy, which made the experience poor overall. Another con was the smell. There was the smell of fried fish wafting around the bar/dining area, which was very unpleasant and difficult to ignore. We figured dessert couldn't be that bad, so we ordered two orders of the rum bread pudding. Unfortunately they were all out...at 4pm? When we walked in, another couple was leaving. We were the only people in there for the duration of our meal, which lasted about an hour. Needless to say, we do not plan on returning. Super slow service - went there at 10 and there was very few people.  Ordered a wine glass and a salad without meat etc and after 35 min still no sign of salad.  Come on how long does it take to throw some greens from a bag on to a plate.  The staff is good but there seems to be management issues as whole thing is super slow.  Food is ok at best - nothing to rave about but when you are staying at the hotel and it's 0 degrees outside what choice do you have really.  Would avoid this place unless it's a snow storm outside and you don't have any winter clothes and can't leave the Westin hotel We decided to go to Bill's Bar and Burger after walking around the RV show at the convention center because it was in a convenient location. I made a reservation via OpenTable and we were seated right away. That was the only positive experience the entire evening. Our server did not come to our table for about 20 minutes to take our drink order and then it took another 20 minutes for him to bring our drinks. The wait for our meals wasn't any better as we waited at least 40 minutes. The server did not come to check on us the entire time we waited. The food was mediocre at best, especially for the price. Again, our server never came to check on us after we were served our meals. It wasn't until everyone was done eating that he came back and we asked for the check immediately. I would definitely not recommend this place. Stayed here over New Years Eve (16/17) and had a terrible check in experience.  We arrived at 3:00 on NYE and knew that it would probably be a long shot to get checked in on time.  However, we didn't realize that we would be unable to check in until around 8:00 and by then we already were forced to leave all of our belongings with concierge and carry on with our night plans.  If we would have waited at the hotel we would have missed dinner and the show we were there to see.  This was frustrating because we weren't able to change our clothes and could only check in until about 1:00am.  Just disappointing but in all fairness the late night staff explained that there were a number of housekeeping call offs which is outside of anyone's control.  Maybe an incentive for the housekeeping staff to work NYE would have eliminated a few call offs.   Finally, we paid for a king room but we were given a double room...honestly by the time we checked in we really just wanted to hit the hay but if we both were larger folks a double bed would have been unacceptable.  Just a very choppy experience and more than likely will roll the dice somewhere else when visiting Pittsburgh. Great food! I like the General Tso's chicken because it isn't as sweet as other places. I order the sauce on the side, so the chicken won't be entirely drenched in the sauce. It's just my preference. Good fried rice and excellent chicken and broccoli. \n\nYou have to order the white meat General Tso's when you come here. It's the best thing on their menu. This tiny little gem lived up to all the local hype! While at a meeting in the Steel Tower, my colleagues highly recommended I try this place. I had to literally run down the escalators to catch it while it was open (it's only open until 2 pm), I got there with minutes to spare. The woman behind the counter greeted me so warmly. Turns out they only take cash so I had to sprint back upstairs to the ATM. By the time I got back and was ready to order, almost all the food they had was sold out (the sign of a very popular joint!) but she was kind enough to quickly make some fresh salad for me. When she learned I had never been there before, she excitedly put together a plate of what was left, which was salad, chicken and beef meatballs, chicken shawarma, hummus and some beans.  I loved every bite!  The ingredients were so fresh and flavorful.  The food clearly made from scratch and with lots of love. I am so jealous of the lucky folks who work in this building. Food and service were great on NYE. We were seated right away and everyone was nice and upbeat. Drinks, appetizers, and meal was all delicious. Tonight my son and I craved some great pizza.  Being from NYC we are often disappointed when trying pizza outside of our home town.  Well Proper did not disappoint.  We had the Margherita and the Mediterranean pies.  Both were amazing.  Very fresh and very tasty.  It's obvious they use the very best ingredients. Great beer selection.  They have lots of good craft beer on tap.  I came for a beer.  I would recommend this place for that.  I had lamb stew and it was fine, but didn't have a lot of flavor.  Atmosphere is great and the staff is friendly and knowledgeable. Went to this restaurant with a group of 4 and we all had excellent dinners. The pizza was delicious and the service was very good. Only letdown was the eggnog bread pudding, which smelled and tasted like bubble gum. Great atmosphere, good service and a great menu...highly recommend the bacon appetizer and the macaroni and cheese brisket. Pizza is good too. The pesto pomodoro read and sounded great, but was weak on Pedro flavor and very salty.\n\nWill definitely go back!!!! Proper Brick Oven is a nice place, but it could easily get crowded as the space is pretty tight.  There is a large bar with TV's so if you wanted to have a date night without missing an important game (*cough* a Steeler game), Proper Brick Oven would definitely bring that ambiance.\n\nI'm not in love with the food.  The pizza is good, but I'm just not personally in love. You do get a decent amount of food for your money so it's definitely worth the price.\n\nI think I was most impressed with the staff.  We went to Proper Brick Oven with a sizable group and they were able to split the check AND add the birthday boy's meal evenly to everyone's check.  It's a small thing, but it makes celebrating a birthday or event that much more enjoyable. Came here just after the lunch crowd on Saturday for some good pizza. My husband and I sat at the bar and were serviced by a busy bartender recovering from a big lunch rush. She wasn't the friendliest and actually mixed up our pizza order with the father and son sitting next to us, therefore we ended up waiting an extra 15 minutes for our pizzas. Drinks were OK but they did have a wide variety on tap. Overpriced for what we got, most likely won't be back. My daughter and I were in Pitt. for an overnight and during an Uber ride, met a driver who was a chef and who used to work here.  It was a snowy evening and the place was not crowded.  Service was good.   We had one drink each plus one beer more for me.  I had pizza, and my daughter had fried chicken.  The pizza had nice flavor but came out soggy.  The crust was very thin which one would expect, however, the sogginess ruined the expected texture.  The chicken was dry, but the crust was nice.  For the prices ($95.00 for our tab) I expected better quality especially since the place wasn't busy.  Service was good.  The place looks nice. Overall, a nice place, but showier and more expensive than reflected in the food. First: you need a reservation.  I had to plan almost a month in advance to get a reservation.  My boyfriend ate the octopus taco, and he said that he's \"had better.\"  (Yes, he has had octopus tacos before!). The slushy margarita was excellent.  My friend loved her Chorizo taco.  My pollo asada was pretty good.  The Korean was delicious, with some nice spice to it. Tacos.  Frozen drinks in a slurpee machine.  Chips and guac.  Reservations you can make on yelp.  Yes, please!\n\nI came here and was instantly excited to try the interesting combinations of tacos available.  My friend and I split the Korean and the carnitas.  I was very impressed with the sauces on both - strong, but not overpowering - and really allowing the meat to stand on its own.  But let's not ignore the awesome taco shell.  Not too soft, and it didn't tear while eating which really pushes this place to the 5th star.  \n\nWe also both got the frozen eggnog - which is not likely in season anymore, but it was incredible.  I would drink anything that came out of that slurpee machine.  \n\nCan't wait to go back! Pretty good.   It's a little on the pricy side and a lot on the crowded side.  Very little seating and no lunch hours is a nice way to create some artificial demand and they've tapped into it.   I just wanted to try some tacos. \n\nThe tacos are great.  The chorizo and queso is average.\n\nThe fact that it's so busy and they artificially cause that to increase demand and make the place seem more hip than it actually is?   That's annoying.  The food is 4 star worthy,  being over priced knocks that down to 3 stars, artificially crowded and average service knocks it to 1 and a place I don't want to go through the trouble of going to again.  These things matter,  a lot. Oh..you thought I was joking when I said I was going to pre-plan 12 reservations to visit Tako once per month? Cause I wasn't.  I've been back quite a few more times and have been able to try a few other menu items to include the elotes corn appetizer, queso fundito, more tacos, crab dip,  the red wine sangria and their pineapple marg. Everything 10 out of 10 (or 5 out of 5 if we're on Yelp terms) every single time, including the service.\n\nIDK why you wouldn't have already gone here after all of the reviews plus how often I know this place is brought up by word-of-mouth, but get online and secure a reservation and prepare to be Wow-ed.\n\nPS..I have another reservation coming up in exactly one week. Pumped. The food here is awesome! Went for my BF's birthday and couldn't have had a better experience. Our server Chris was awesome and very knowledgeable about the drinks and menu. We started with the ceviche which was great. We ordered the Chorizo, Baja, Steak, and Carnitas tacos. All were awesome and so flavorful but my favorite is the Baja, since I'm a Cali girl I love my fish! It's also the one with the least amount of spice. They brought out a Tres Laches Cake with a candle since it was my BF's birthday and that was really good as well. Definitely going to become one of our staple restaurants when we're downtown. Also the drinks were strong and good, try the Thai Coconut drink if you want something really tasty and different! I dined here around Christmas with my friend while I was in town.  I will say Pittsburgh dining has come a long way since I lived there!  I really enjoyed tako.  Cocktails are heavily centered around tequila, which is to be expected as it is a taqueria, and were delicious.  I tried the mezcal version of the Old Fashioned and was pleasantly surprised.  \nWe started with the guacamole with blue cheese and duck confit, and then split a few orders of tacos: Korean, Pollo & Al Pastor.  Everything was really tasty and was reminiscent of my favorite taco joint in Chicago (shout out to Big Star!) so I was impressed.  Service was friendly and the space was done really well.  I think it caters to bigger parties as if you go with only 2 people, you are seated at a high top near the bar.  My only gripe is that I thought it was a bit expensive.  Our guacamole was good and had expensive ingredients, however it cost $18, and tacos are about $7 each so I thought it was a lot. Tako is very popular, and if you're planning on eating at a more common dinner hour, you will want to make a reservation online. As for me and my wife, however, we arrived right as it opened (5pm) and were seated immediately. You can try your luck and do the same (you could also sit and eat at the bar). \n\nInside ambiance is truly incredible. I really love the vibe of this restaurant. It's two floors. Pretty dark. Edison bulbs everywhere. It's very trendy. They have octopus tentacle sconces on the wall . . . I mean, where else do you see that? \n\nWe came and ate during restaurant week. We received chips and guac, 2 appetizers (ceviche and papa bravas), and 2 tacos (al pastor & pollo asado). The chips and gauc and salsa were great!! Portion was huge and was delicious. The two appetizers were also very tasty. The Ceviche app was small but sooo flavorful. I was impressed. It was refreshing. The papa bravas . . . Listen . . . I swear I'd come back just for those potatoes. I can't explain it. They're perfect. They're delicious. Honestly, you'll do yourself a disservice if you don't order that appetizer. Heck, id order that over one of their tacos. Yeah. The tacos were pretty good. My wife had the chicken but she didn't care for it too much because the chicken tasted gummy. I tasted to see . . . Yeah, they were a bit undercooked and tasted semi-strange as a result (I'm sure that was a fluke and not the norm). I thought the al pastor was pretty good as well, but I honestly wasn't blown away! For the normal price tag of these tacos, I don't know id rush back. I thought the appetizers were more appealing, which gives me a huge internal conflict as the name of the restaurant suggests where the emphasis should be! \n\nBut taken as a whole, from ambiance to service (incredible wait staff!!) to meal . . . This is a 4 star restaurant and well worth your visit and the wait. I will 100% come back and try the Tako taco. That's what is apparently out of this world, and I will update this review when I do try it! \n\nExtra: Tako also had a stand in the Christmas village in Market Square. All I can say is, wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Soooo so so good. I want the sandwiches they were selling every day of my life. If we are all so fortunate enough to see that stand there again next season, you do not want to miss!! So, my wife and I were visiting beautiful Pittsburgh for the Steelers game. We happened to be there for New Years Eve, we tried getting into restaurants, but they were packed.  We stumbled on this place, TAKO and were told there were only room at the bar, which was perfect for us.  We ordered some beers, were greeted by a very friendly bartender and told of the drinks and how they served their tacos.  My wife had the carnitas tacos (two on an order) and I had the chicken. \n\nSo, being Mexican-American (my wife and I) and coming from California, where there are endless taco shops, we didn't expect much from this place, especially in Pittsburgh, PA.  But, we were wrong!!!!!  HOLY SMOKES, so, the tortillas are hand made(can't get better than that), the meats had a wonderful taste to them and were served with salsa, avocado, cilantro, queso fresco(fresh Mexican cheese) and were packed with meat!!!!!!!!!  \nSome of the BEST TACOS my wife and I have EVER!!! had!!!  \n\nCome to find out this restaurant is owned by a chef who also owns two other restaurants in town.  Looks like he did his homework really good on how to perfect a great taco in Pittsburgh. \n\nMy wife and I would fly back to Pittsburg (If we were rich, lol) just to eat at this place!! that's how good and fun this place was. \n\nI highly, highly recommend this place for anyone visiting Pittsburgh.  THIS PLACE IS A MUST and coming from two Latino's from Cali, it got 4 thumbs up from us!!! This place seems to get packed easily. We didn't have a reservation, so it was a free-for-all for bar seats. The host was super cool and made room for us at a table that was between reservations. Definitely over the top in costumer service. Wait staff was also great!\n\nWe went for the Pittsburgh Winter Restaurant Week Deal (Chips, Guac, red or verde salsa; choice of 2 apps; and choice of 2 tacos). The salsa verde (tomatillo) was rich and smoky and I definitely recommend. Other apps (guac, papas bravas, and ceviche) were also delicious. For dinner, We chose the Korean Beef BBQ taco and the Al Pastor Taco. Korean taco was very good, but the Al Pastor was fantastic!! I definitely recommend getting that one for sure! For dessert they had 3 options, but one sounded the most unique and we got that one (because why not!?) It was a chocolate bread pudding, with espresso/chocolate sauce, brownie bits sprinkled on top, bananas foster, and house-made Mexican chocolate ice cream... That was all in one dessert!!!! It was big enough to split (but small/good enough to finish even after a huge meal).\n\nI plan to go back and explore the other taco options, because they all looked amazing! Our meal at Tako was great as always, from the food to the service. We love the decor and presentation.  One suggestion would be to add a second vegetarian option that doesn't include mushrooms. Tako is amazing. Getting a reservation is nearly impossible though, so plan early.\n\nThe poke was interesting. I liked it. The whipped lime was a really good touch. The papa bravas were also really good.\n\nAll of the tacos are great, but the Tako taco and the Baja were my favorites. But really, every single taco was amazing. I can't believe it has taken me this long to write a review for Tako! Tonight was the second time I have visited Tako and it is easily becoming one of my favorite places to eat in Pittsburgh! Both times I have gone during the week with my girlfriends. If you are looking to go here you basically need to make reservations weeks in advance... but it is so worth the wait.\n\nThe atmosphere inside of Tako is unlike anything I have ever seen before. From walking in and immediately seeing the cooks making their famous tacos, to the dim lighting and candle lit tables.  This place is sure to catch your eye. Both times I visited we were sat upstairs in the booths. I love that it is a private & intimate setting! \n\nWe actually ended up having the same waiter both times I was there! He was very attentive & helpful. Tonight he recommended the watermelon basil margarita for my drink which was AMAZING! I have also tried the grapefruit sage margarita & my girlfriend got the sangria- you basically can't go wrong with any of their cocktails. To start, we ordered the queso fundido. I recommend to order this with tortilla chips instead of the warm tortillas that is typically served with. This is LITERALLY finger licking good. I am obsessed.  \n\nFor meals on both occasions I ordered tacos.....duh. My friends and I split the Korean, al pastor, and chorizo tacos a few months ago. We loved all of them, but I probably wouldn't order the chorizo again (we all agreed the texture & the fried egg we could do without). Tonight I had the carnitas, which were to die for. I truly believe you can't come to Tako and not have a great experience. There is nothing bad I can say about this place. Everyone needs to go to Tako!!! In our opinion, tako doesn't live up to the hype. Prices for food and drink were high and not commensurate with the product. Very noisy & so dark, it's hard to read the menu. Someone asked a week later what we had for dinner & we really couldn't recall.  We did say the $9.00 potatoes were out of this world & truly memorable for a potato lover! Try Bakersfield tacos...now there's some flavor! After months of talking about going to t\u00e4k\u014d with my fianc\u00e9, we finally were able to get reservations for a Friday night at 7:15. We both were so excited to finally experience all the hype surrounding t\u00e4k\u014d. We arrived right on time and immediately seated at our table. I was already impressed by the vibe and decor of the restaurant. We both ordered drinks and put in our appetizer order while we tried to figure out the difficult task of which tacos to order. I ordered the Violet Pilot and she ordered the Watermelon Basil Margarita. I thoroughly enjoyed my drink. It wasn't too sweet, and I could really taste the smokiness of the mezcal at the end. (I love to try variations of drinks that have egg whites as an ingredient). She was happy with her margarita as well.\n\nWe ordered the Queso Fundido as an appetizer. It was a tough decision between that or the Papa Bravas. The Queso Fundido was a great choice and I would definitely consider ordering it again. It came with four little tortillas. It was a great combination of cheese and chorizo and all the flavors were a great start to an amazing meal.\n\nNow onto my favorite part of the meal and what I was most anticipating: the tacos. I ordered the Chorizo and she ordered the Baja. (She tends to never to be able to finish her meal, so I was excited and looking forward to trying both kinds of tacos). These tacos were hands down the best I've ever had. The Chorizo tacos blew my mind and I enjoyed every single bite! I loved how they incorporated a fried egg on the taco; the yolk added a lot of extra flavor! As anticipated, she was full and gave me her last Baja taco. It was very flavorful! I feel that the slaw on the taco brought all the flavors together and it was a nice touch. However, the Chorizo taco was definitely my favorite so far! I can't wait to come back to try all the other varieties that they have to offer!\n\nOur bill came out to be $60 (plus tip) for two drinks, an appetizer, and two entrees. I felt our meal was definitely worth the cost. Yes, it can get pricey quick and I see how everyone says it can be expensive.  t\u00e4k\u014d is now one of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh and I look forward to returning! I went back and forth a bit on whether to give tako a 4- or 5-star review; I wish there was a 4.5-star option! I made a reservation about a month in advance, which I read was recommended from others who have also left tips/reviews for tako. Our party increased upon arrival and I wasn't able to give advance notice to the restaurant. They did a great job giving us options to get us seated more quickly, or to have a more comfortable place to enjoy our evening. We opted to wait an extra 30 minutes or so past our reservation time for one of the tables upstairs, and I appreciated that the host and hostess were constantly updating us on the status of our wait. Our waiter provided great service throughout the evening as well. He was personable, willing to give recommendations, and put up with our indecision and need to have a few more minutes to continue perusing the menu.\n\nNow for the food... the most important part, right?! The tacos were yummy. There are several types of meat or vegetarian options to choose from, and there are also non-taco items that you can order. Why do that when they are known for their tacos? Here is why I couldn't decide between a 4- or 5-star review. You can't mix or match. Each plate comes with a couple of tacos, but both tacos are the same. What would be awesome is if you could section off the menu so that you can order two or three tacos on a plate and have each one be different. I really wanted to try a couple of different tacos, but at $12 or more a plate, that wasn't an option. There was one \"party\" option that allowed you to order five different tacos (if I remember correctly) and you receive two of each. This is great if you have a group of people who want to split the options. Just wish there was a smaller version of this option available when you can only really eat 2 or 3 tacos in a sitting.\n\nOther than that one thing, tako was great. I think it lives up to the hype. I haven't had the opportunity to find decent Mexican or Tex-Mex style food in and around Pittsburgh. Out of what I have had the opportunity to try, this one is the superior option. It is a really great date night spot as well, or a great place to snag a reservation before going to see a show at a local theater. I would definitely go back. Came here for date night with my fiance during restaurant week (Jan 9) and beat the crowd. Unless you have a reservation, the wait for a table can be more than an hour. We got there right when they opened at 5pm and sat at the bar since that area is open seating/first come, first served. We ordered one of the restaurant week specials which was a pretty good deal because we got to try a few dishes: street corn, ceviche, guac, the korean bbq taco, pork belly taco and some chips and tomatillo on the side. Everything was so good. The only thing I wasn't diggin was my drink - I ordered the Lychee & Pepper, since I'm a big fan of lychee. I could not taste the lychee at all. While the presentation of it was nice, the flavor was unexpected and a little off for me. 5 stars for the food, customer service and really nice ambience! This is currently my favorite place in Pittsburgh. I don't know how they do it, but their tacos are fantastic. I have yet to try something on the menu that wasn't incredible. The chef's attention to detail is superb. I also really enjoy the semi-open kitchen. \n\nThe restaurant itself is on the smaller side, but it's still very welcoming. At times, it can be difficult to be seated, but I'm not complaining, because their food makes up for any inconvenience. \n\nThe staff is pleasant, knowledgeable, and genuine. They are all familiar with the menu, and they take pride in their work. It's apparent that everyone at this restaurant loves the food. \n\nThe prices here are reasonable and commensurate with the portion sizes that they offer. They also have a fairly extensive drink menu, which caters to their Mexican theme. Overall, I strongly recommend this restaurant. Interesting mix of tasty food, good drink, nice service and strong energy. Food was terrific. Taco don't disappoint. Great flavor. More than adequate portions. Service has always been helpful. The place is visually interesting. It's a bit loud for some-music and people. This may not be a place to bring your young children. Trendy and cool atmosphere, but the food is \"just okay\" in my opinion... especially for expensive price. The streak and chicken tacos were good, but the pork was salty as hell, and the salmon was bland. People think since the wait list for a reservation is so long it must be fantastic. It's a trick! I sat down with a bit of a chip on my shoulder. I got bumped into enough in the crowded hostess area to be annoyed and I typically am disappointed when I go to places that have been hyped. Soon enough the only \"chip\" was the fresh, hot tortilla kind that came in an ample portion, with terrific house-made salsa and guac. The chips themselves were top-notch and addicting. We then sampled the ceviche and the street corn. It was my first time trying ceviche and I think it's just not my thing. A little lime-y for my taste, but beautifully presented. On to the street corn. It should be required for all patrons to try it...I can't recall having a better side dish anywhere. My description won't do it justice. I'm talking \"side-dish at my last meal\" good. TRY IT! My fiancee and I had pollo asado, baja (fish) and the bistec (steak) tacos. The chicken was anything but plain, and bursting with flavor. The fish was battered perfectly and the toppings checked all the boxes - a little saltiness, a little sweetness, a little bitterness from the radish, but tons of flavor. The steak was pretty rare (probably avoid if you prefer well or medium well) but super tender and flavorful. When I dine out, I want to find something I can't easily replicate. Though I wish I could (especially with that street corn), everything here is so intricately spiced and seasoned, there's no way I'm replicating these flavors. Our server was fantastic, enthusiastic and engaging. Definitely worth the wait and the crowded atmosphere...I will definitely be back Went here for a bachelorette dinner with 8 other women.  Waiter was charismatic, staff was polite, but food took a long time to arrive (we were essentially the only ones in the restaurant, there were a lot of us, though) and was **WAY** overpriced.  $36 dollars for 4 scallops and no side dish-- left hungry.  I understand smaller quantities of food with richer flavors is the proposed concept, but I've been to restaurants with Michelin stars which had lower prices for mains.  Scallops were very good, but not worth that price by a long shot.  I had better scallops (which came with crab risotto and asparagus) at Butcher and the Rye around the block for around $25.  Wish I could review more of the food, but couldn't afford anything else!  Wouldn't recommend. My wife and I wanted to experience pittsburgh's restaurant week and chose Habitat.  My wife does not use milk products and eating out can be difficult.  Habitat's special three course meal had a just a few choices.  We let our server Fiona know of her diet issues and she took phenomenal care of us.  She substituted goat cheese on the salad, changed the dressing due to cream in the dressing.  When it came to desert (the hardest of all) Fiona and Katie the pastry chef went out of their way to make her a meringue and marinated fruit desert.  My wife was so happy she was giddy as a teenager.  Katie also came out and gave us the rest of the meringue to take home and also gave us how she made it!  \n\nIt was one of the best meals we have ever had! While the food was delicious, one meal in our party took a significant amount of time longer than the others. Even though it was the same thing as one of the other members of the party ordered. They also sat us at a table that had the sun glaring at the one side of the table. We were allowed to move to another table but then they realized we needed to move again due to later reservations. I would definitely recommend the brunch but not the service. I'm usually a pretty picky eater and I don't like eating outside my comfort zone so I was a little hesitant to order here. But after our attentive and very nice waiter suggested it I got the Mac Attack grilled cheese and it was almost a spiritual experience. I have never eaten something so heavenly before. It was so lit. And it's all thanks to our waiter, Eddie. Hands down best sushi in Pittsburgh. Their sushi specials are always super creative and delicious. I've never had sushi this fresh in Pittsburgh. I lived in Japan for a few years when I was younger, and I remember how high the quality of fish was. Penn Ave Fish Company knows what they're doing. My girlfriend and I have made this our go to spot for special occasions (birthdays, anniversaries, etc). We usually get the sushi special, a special roll, and two regular maki rolls. We never have any left over. It is to die for! Let's just say my husband and I still continue to speak about the horrible night !! We went for restaurant week.. So we did the 3 course meal for a fixed price .. And the offered a wine pairing so we took advantage of it .. The wine was excellent .. We enjoyed each glass .. However.. They never brought our first course .. Came with our dinner plates and we indicated we never had our appetizers .. The waiter took our dinner plates away .. And brought our appetizers which were very good !!! Remind you this was an hour after being sat !! Luckily we had the wine to hold us over .. However .. For dinner .. I had the Beef and Lamb Pot Pie .. And I cannot say how salty it was !! Very salty .. And the two sauces just did not mix .. My husband had the pork chop and indicated it was good but nothing to brag about .. The Banana pudding with whiskey sauce was very good !! However .. All in all.. We agree we would not come back .. And after everything..  not once did a manager come by to apologize for the mix up with the appetizer and entree !! The best service, entrees,  wines and desserts.  \n\nThe servers attention to detail and catering to the customer reigns supreme.  The entrees whether steak, wild boar,  lamb, or poultry was always perfectly cooked and aesthetically appealing. \n\nThe wine list is extensive;  there is a wine cellar, beyond what the wine list displays. \n\nThe desserts look like they should be on the cover of \"Bon Appetit\" and each is delectable. \n\nThis restaurant was a Dirona award winner. If you want to impress someone,  or a  top-notch dining experience,  this is the restaurant to choose. \n\nI've eaten here a dozen times. Always consistent quality. We decided to take advantage of the Bonus Days of Pittsburgh Restaurant Week and booked a reservation at the Carlton.  We had high hopes, but we're severely let down by the food, service, and whole experience.  \n\nPerhaps we were \"too young\" to dine in there.  Like a kid sitting at the adult table, we were essentially ignored by the waitstaff and, when ordering from the Restaurant Week menu, I felt like we were written off right there.  We had to request silverware from our server and received either badly tarnished or dirty spoons... so much that we had to ask for new ones.  Also my husband didn't receive a napkin and had to ask for one as well. \n\nThe almond chicken salad arrived and it looked pretty.  The tomatoes were fresh and colorful.  The chicken had zero seasoning and the salad had way too much dressing.  It was supposed to have cheese, but it was missing from my plate.  I simply couldn't eat this salad.  I picked at it and attempted to salvage a few bites, but it was not enjoyable.\n\nHubs ordered the seafood cioppino.  I found it to be salty tomato soup... it wasn't something to write home about.\n\nMy entr\u00e9e was the bronzino and it left me baffled. Why on earth would you put the crispy skin of the bronzino in a broth?  It becomes completely saturated and uncrispy.  It needed to be seasoned and the red cabbage and mushrooms were just drenched in a sweet and sour broth which was... just not good.  \n\nHubs enjoyed the pork chop.  The barbecue sauce made the chop, but again it just wasn't that great.\n\nFinally dessert - the waiter forgot that we ordered dessert and handed hubs the menu.  We reminded him that we already placed our orders and he seemed confused before he went back to the kitchen and put in a rush order for our desserts.  \n\nMy husband ordered the raspberry cheesecake and he didn't save me a bite... I'll take that as a \"I liked it.\"  I ordered the banana bread pudding.  I strongly believe someone mixed up the salt and sugar when making the caramel sauce.  I mean it was SALTY. The ice cream was tasty and the banana bread pudding was just okay.  The caramel sauce ruined it for me.\n\nI would like to give kudos to the bus boy.  He was the only prompt and attentive employee we encountered.\n\nWould I return?  I don't think so.  I see other reviews and feel like we went to a completely different restaurant.  Our experience was just poor and I wouldn't recommend it. Still waitng for our our check, but I could not wait to express my disappointment.  Server was chatty but not focused.  It took twenty minutes to get a menu, and the food was cold.  My husbands fish was dry, overcooked and cold.  The place was worn out and in need of a complete update, and the manager was on his phone as best we could tell.  Save your money and get fast food; it's better. Great place to go downtown if you are looking for something hearty and decently portioned. I caught up with a friend during the week here. Stopped in and ordered a chicken salad. It gets pretty packed around lunch, so plan ahead. \n\nOrdered the food and went to sit down to wait. It took about 10 minutes to get my sandwich. It was huge. If I wasn't so greedy, I would have saved some for dinner. But I am greedy, so I ate. And ate. And ate until I cleared my plate. It was really fresh, and well seasoned. \n\nThe inside of it reminds me of a school cafeteria. If it was up to me, I would do take out, and enjoy my lunch in another location. \n\nBut overall, you can't beat fresh, affordable, fast food. At the daily special rates price point, the quality/tastiness of food, and friendly service, I am rating Zorba's 5 out of 5.  Gyro's and fries here are delicious, however my favorite special is the buffalo chicken salad with ranch, so good.  In general they have juicy tasty chicken, I think its grilled or baked, but never disappoints.  \n\nThe restaurant is very clean and the open kitchen design is a appealing to me, because I see the cooks using gloves and demonstrating safe food handling.\n\nI would knock a half star off for the drink selections, but there is usually something i like.  Also the line can get long during rushes and the staff works hard to take orders quickly and get the food out. Just went to Social and sat at the bar on Sunday around 5pm. I wish I knew her name, but I don't...she had a ponytail with an ombre. She w\\was very good at making cocktails and we had a great girls' night there. They have an amazing liquor selection and the vibe was great. At this point, Social House Seven is pretty mediocre. I suspect they will get better in a few months. AMPD Group had similar issues with Local and Steel Cactus. I'd recommend going elsewhere for now.\n\nWe had the Mango Rangoon and Pear Wonton desserts. The idea is awesome, but they were greasy and just not very good. The idea is there, they just have to fix the delivery.\n\nThe sushi was standard. If you're downtown and just looking for sushi though, you have Penn Ave Fish further downtown and Sushi Kim closer to the Strip District.\n\nThe entrees were fine, but I'd expect more than just fine. The coconut fried rice was alright, the tofu was good, the bok choy was eh.\n\nIf their performance with Local and Steel Cactus is any indication, I suspect they'll be pretty good by late Spring. This place was just plain exceptional. Pricey, but if you're willing to shell out some hard earned coin to experience some culinary finds that Pittsburgh doesn't normally offer, this is the place. We had everything from sushi to the amazing robata grill (the kobe style beef is to die for) and even the simple grilled vegetables were a real comestible delight. Were there shortcomings? Of course. we had a few glitches in the service as most restaurants trying to find their \"sea legs\" will experience, and not every dish was a home run, but overall the entire table agreed this one is a winner. This place is beautiful! As soon as you walk through the doors, there is a fish tank on the floor right on the entrance. The atmosphere is very elegant and the waiters are very attentive. \n\nWe made reservations online for five people and came here for dinner on a Tuesday night. We ordered sushi and sashimi to share which ranged from spicy tuna rolls to sea urchin sashimi. We also the new style sashimi dish in which we were informed that there were 8 pieces, then the waitress said it was actually 6 pieces. However, when it came out, it was actually 5 pieces. Although the sushi was good, I wasn't really impressed as the rolls were pretty small and the sashimi were thin for the price that they are charging. \n\nOverall, it was a good experience. Perhaps we will try other things on the menu the next time. Very confusing menu. We thought we ordered miso soup but we got brought miso corn patties (as if that was a thing). We thought we ordered surf and turf as an entree and it was a double order of sushi. The best part of this place was the decor. Very swanky and cool. \n\nOtherwise the food was extremely hit or miss. Tuna tartar was fantastic. Sea bass was reasonably good. Everything else was mediocre at best. Every vegetable in the place appeared to be fried - I didn't realize you could ruin broccoli like that. I had to send back the miso soup because it was inedible. Miso soup - that is hard to ruin. \n\nService was friendly, but distracted. Bar was very slow. We got our second round of drinks well after we were done eating (to their credit, however, the server comped these drinks). \n\nThis place would be great if they upped the quality of raw ingredients, had a much lighter hand on seasoning, and did some more staff training to work out the kinks. Another great restaurant by Amp'd Group based and located in Pittsburgh. \n\nGood sushi. Sushi Bar. Nightlife. Large bar area. Dining. \n\nInteresting and unique libations.  \n\nHot spot for Nightlife, see and be seen. Also good spot for date night, group dinners, parties, and business social networking. Local neighborhood eatery and vibrant bar scene. The atmosphere in this place is great. Really nice new vibe in Pittsburgh. The food fell waaaaay short. Sushi was ehh. But seaweed salad no way. Better at giant eagle, I have a hard time even typing that. Also got soup and it was like water and salt but mostly salt. But you should check it out the bar for happy hour with friends. The bar area is really fun!! Just avoid the food!", "stars": 3.9}, "Duquesne Heights": {"year": 2017, "text": "Eat in the bar and off the bar menu. Decent sandwiches, appetizers and burgers. Steak sandwich is very good. View is great, and the deck is an amazing place to have a drink or two on a nice day.\nDo NOT, however, eat upstairs in the \"steakhouse.\" The ambience is that of your grandmothers kitchen in 1960, the service is abysmal, the food is at best mediocre, and it is WAY overpriced. Kids not allowed!? I saw the door to the place and an empty restaurant inside at lunch time. A rude woman told us we couldn't stay because we had our well behaved children with us. I will never be back - even without kids.\nCan you put this on the website at least? Gezz! Monterrey Bay is easy to praise, mostly for the extraordinary view and attractive dining room. The praise is well deserved. However, I can't get to 5* because the food is only good, not great. Last night we had two different preparations of sole as mains, the gratin potato side, and the signature desert, 'Angel Food Grilled Cheese Sandwich' to finish. Everything was fine, but nothing was remarkably good. Service was just right and the wine list offered a couple of fairly priced California Chardonnays, a must for me, although they were well hidden. This is obviously a special occasion restaurant, with a very memorable view and prices to match. I haven't been here since their remodel and revamp, so I was interested in seeing how the restaurant had changed. The aesthetic here now is much more modern and reflective of the high end dining experience you get here. As I'm sure you already know, don't dine here unless you're prepared to pay at least $50 per person. Entrees here vary in cost, but average probably around $35. There are also a variety of appetizers, soups, salads and side dishes, as well as alcohol and dessert. It adds up very quickly. I had the Lobster Bisque soup as a starter. The server brought the bowl to me, with the lump lobster inside and then poured the soup overtop into the bowl in front of me. It was a really nice and flavorful soup with a considerable amount of lobster meat. For dinner, I had the Crab Cakes. The cakes were very generous in size and had more meat than filler. I would definitely recommend them just like many other Yelpers here have. I also got to try the lobster mac and cheese. This was also delicious. It is on the sides menu, but was big enough to have as an Entree. Even though I didn't give this place 5 stars, it's still really good!!! The fish is so clearly fresh and the preparations are great. For fish lovers, the less you do is more. The chef really does seem to realize that. The chef uses earthy whole ingredients that work really well. I had the Chilean Sea Bass and my husband had the halibut. We both loved our dishes. For an appetizer we had the sampler that included crab cakes, fish skewer, and shrimp. All Sooooo good! The crab cake had so much crab! The sauces everything was paired with was perfect!\nFor dessert we had the steamed chocolate latte. It was so creative and cute and it tasted fantastic! We devoured the whole thing!!! \n\nNow onto why I to why I gave this place 4 stars instead of 5. At this price point, I think a stronger critique is more informative. In my opinion, the chef really knows what they are doing with the fish and the sauces, so I wish they would make full entrees. At steakhouses I understand doing sides family style, but I was hoping the chef would prepare a great side that would pair nicely with the fish and sauces. Perhaps other people might prefer a la carte sides, but I prefer the chef to pick it if they know what they are doing and this chef really does! We got tricolor potatoes which were really good. We also got flash fried Brussels sprouts, which were a little greasy. I thought they'd be nice and crunchy, but they were more soggy with grease.\n\nAll in all I will definitely go back next time we are in town, but they can stand to improve a few things to make this place perfect!! Oh and service was really good as well. They didn't bother us too much but they were attentive. Definitely the best seafood restaurant I've been to in Pittsburgh and possibly ever! My boyfriend and I dined here for dinner on New Year's Eve. I made the reservation over a month in advance and requested a table against the window since this is on Mt. Washington and overlooks the city. Unfortunately, my request was not honored even though there was an open table by the window when we arrived and for over an hour after we ordered. A couple who walked in and sat at the bar ended up getting it later. We were seated right next to the bar and by the back of the house/dishwasher so it was pretty noisy. \n\nI also checked on their website several times leading up to New Years to see whether there was any special event or tasting menu offered and there was nothing mentioned. However, a prix fixe menu was given to us along with the regular menu when we were seated. It was not explained to us that the prix fixe was the ONLY option until I tried to order something from the regular menu. Not a big deal, but I think it should have been mentioned on the website or when we made the reservation a month prior. \n\nThe food was pretty good and portions were fairly generous. The view is obviously the highlight. I would probably go back and order off the regular menu and insist on sitting upstairs in the main dining area. I'm giving this 4 stars because of the view.  It's breathtaking.  The food is just ok.  Service is great though. Wow - totally impressed with this restaurant - the ambiance was perfect - good beer list - only had apps but the hummus and Bada bing shrimp were delicious.  The views from the bar were amazing - JJ em was the most gracious of hosts and the service of Nate was super attentive and superior.  Will certainly come back each time I come to town!!!! Was only expecting the good view on a snowy night; but found a very friendly staff, JJ & our waiter; but the food was the biggest surprise.. ALL of the entree's, a meat dish, a seafood dish, and an Italian dish were EXCELLENT.  In regards to pricing, $10 more per plate than an Applebee's for the view and food quality is a no brainer. Will absolutely be back on my next return trip. Picture this, Its Playoff weekend in Pittsburgh, we have a group of 6 that came from NYC too go to the Steelers  playoff game.  \nSo I hear some great things about the Food at Altius.  I decide to make reservations for dinner the night before the game.   \nI read their web site that says dress is business casual,   No sneakers, No sweat's  No T shirts or sports wear. \nLiving in NYC and original from Pittsburgh,  we take dress code very casual,  so we dress accordingly\nDress Jeans, dress shoes, some of us had button down collared  shirts  and 2 of were wearing Tommy Bahama Pull overs.   Here is where the problem came in,  we were informed by the hostess that we could not be seated due to a team logo on our Tommy Bahama Pullovers.  \nOk I understand maybe if it were a Game jersey or a Cheap Walmart shirt, but we it is a Tommy Bahama Pullover that is respectfully designed.  \nWe explained this to the hosted, and she agreed, but did not want to take a chance and called the manager.    The Manager came over and said no and cannot wear those shirts because it is sportswear and has team logo on it, and does not comply with our dress code.  I must say he was very rude and arrogant  how he approached us and spoke to us.  \nLiving in NYC, I have dined at many restaurants,  and never have I been or seen anyone turned away because of our attire.  \n  Maybe at  Daniel or Per Se they may have said something.    I have had dinners at Del-Posto, Gotham Bar and Grill and Gramercy Tavern, where our dress was more casual than the night at Altius and were not turned away. \nSo I did not have a chance to taste the food to see if it is all the Hype, But as for personality and customer service...  Horrible !   FYI  6 people Dropping at least $200 a head  is $1200 +   oh  what a shame for the waiter that lost a table and $240 + tip.. \nIll assume that would have  been a Good night for a waiter in Pittsburgh.. \nWe went to View 412 after being rejected . The service was great and the food was as good.  \nAlso it was a sign from God, that we went to View 412 while there we had the pleasure to meet  Arch Bishop David Zubik,  and other member of his clergy.    ( They Loved our Tommy Bahama Steelers  pullovers ) For my money, Altius offers the best dining experience possible in Pittsburgh, emblematic of the city's beauty and vibrant culinary scene. \n\nYou absolutely can't beat the view, for starters. No matter where you're seated - they don't accept reservations for a window, sadly - the large windows offer wonderful panoramic vistas of the city's gorgeous skyline, rivers, and stadia.\n\nThe food was excellent, down to the multiple amuse-bouches offered prior to and after our meal. I had the Amish Chicken Breast, which positively dripped with wholesome, melt-in-mouth goodness. The spaetzle and greens played really well with the perfectly cooked chicken. My date had Chilean Sea Bass, with pappardelle, greens, and bacon bits, and described it as 'one of the best things I've ever eaten'. Our wine pairings - Sauvignon Blanc and Chardonnay respectively - were well picked by the excellent staff.\n\nThe best part? The restaurant brought out a little cherry Ring Pop to surprise my date with the delicious 'S'mores' dessert - a running gag between my date and I since our first ever conversation. They were so helpful and cooperative, and I couldn't have been happier at her gleeful surprise. They made me look wonderfully smooth! :)\n\nAll in all, an excellent experience, and well worth the price - a fraction of what you'd pay for views, food, and ambience like this in most any other city. Highly recommended! My wife and I dined here for New Year's Eve.  There was a 4-course prix fixe menu.\n\n1st course: \n\nSteak tartare (me).  Delicious, perfectly seasoned large portion. Put it on a piece of the grilled naan with some of the potent, coarse mustard and you have the perfect hamburger.\n\nCrab toast (wife).  Also very good, lots of crab.\n\nWin: me\n\n2nd course:\n\nCalamari Milanese salad (me). Not a big fan, it was just OK.  This was more of an arugula salad with a fried calamari steak on the side.  The salad had too much dressing and the squid was too breaded and over cooked.\n\nCrab bisque (wife). Delicious, rich and buttery.  \n\nWin: wife\n\n3rd course:\n\nRack of lamb (me).  Cooked perfectly, purple potato and butternut squash gratin was a great complement.\n\nFilet mignon (wife). Also cooked perfectly, mashed purple potatoes were delicious.\n\nWin: tie\n\n4th course:\n\nOnly one option was provided.  The strawberries and champagne.  They were good, nothing exquisite, but to be fair we were both so stuffed it would have been hard to comprehend anything more complicated.\n\nOverall this was a close battle, but I will give the win to my wife since the gap between the second courses was much bigger than between the first courses.\n\nPS, the view was unbelievable. One of the best restaurants I've been to in a long time! Everything was wonderful....the cocktails were awesome, the bread they come around with and the extras they serve you are a great touch. And, of course, the food...I've never been so indecisive trying to pick my dinner. This is not a place I can frequent, unfortunately....but I will be back for my next occasion. We ordered the sea bass and duck entrees...fantastic. I NEED to try the pork though! The restaurant itself was not so upscale that it was uncomfortable...quite the opposite. The service was outstanding and I could really appreciate going to a restaurant where I don't feel like I'm in the middle of the conservation of the folks around me.", "stars": 3.6}, "East Carnegie": {"year": 2016, "text": "Basically they put store bought salsa on everything. The staff was rude and they are super cheap with their drinks and chips/salsa. Maybe I'm just used to the great service and food at Emilianos. The food looked like a bunch of slop and when someone at my table asked for double meat on their tacos they were rude and said no because the meat is already portioned out. Ok...... So you don't want extra money for extra meat? Weird. I love this place! I've had several items off the menu and I'm always pleased. It's an excellent option if you want take out on a Friday night and I think it's also a BYOB. The al pastor tacos are the best. Make sure you order a side of hot sauce to go with your meal! It's definitely a better option than any of the local pizza places for take out. The food is great . Very good flavor . The workers are very nice and sufficient. \nI will definitely go back anytime. My family decided to try this little restaurant after driving past it so many times.  We heard mixed reviews about it and wanted to see for ourselves.  The numerous signs made it very clear that only the first basket of chips was free and drinks only came with one refill.  The food itself wasn't great.  I got a chicken taco and burrito that came with rice and beans.  The taco and burrito were bland and seemed thrown together. The rice was hard and painfully bland while the beans were soggy and seemed to be watery.  There are many better options for good Mexican food.  The food here just isn't worth it. Mendoza Express is an authentic restaurant serving up some of the best tasting dishes. My former office was a hop skip and jump away and I'd have lunch there 3-4 times a week. Now I'm lucky if I get back every six months but when I do it's always perfection. The homemade chips and salsa are so good that I fill up before my meal arrives. I've only had the chorizo tacos and beef quesadilla so far but I'll definitely be back to try more of the menu. The chorizo tacos are some of the best I've ever had and the quesadilla was very good as well. You get 3 tacos and a side of beans or rice for like $6 bucks. Such a good deal. Your money goes a long way here. Well worth it. This place was a very small Mexican restaurant. The tables are covered in plastic(not appealing). To start off, each table received chips and salsa. I actually enjoyed both. Each additional chips and salsa you would have to pay extra for. I got a lunch special at a reasonable price with a small beef burrito and a small chicken fajita with a side of rice. The flavors were actually great, but they were so juicy/watery that it made everything very soggy and hard to eat. I like salsa on top of my fajitas and burritos and I had to pay more for some salsa for my meal. Overall ok, I'd at least go back again and give them another shot. Like I said, the flavors were there. Also for lunch, the portion sizes were great. Okay -- I really wanted to love this place... despite some of the reviews... But, they are true. Signs everywhere about only getting one basket of chips and salsa and one free drink refill are not very welcoming. At all. \nThe salsa wasn't even good. Too runny and not enough flavor. Also, I'm wondering if their recipe changed since some of the photos a few years ago? My rice was so plain. Didn't resemble Mexican rice at all. \nOh, before I forget... I AM Mexican... I realize different parts of the country do things differently... but the majority of items I had lacked flavor. \n\nPositives: in and out in under 40 mins so good for a lunch trip\nThe tacky d\u00e9cor keeps you busy\nThe spicy salsa is REALLY spicy... (that could be a negative for some)\nPrice: I ordered the Dinner Combo #1: Chicken enchilada, chicken fajita, chicken taco and beef tostada with rice and beans and guac for $13\nGuacamole was decent\nServer/owner was very nice\n\nNegatives: Bland and soggy food\nVery tiny space\nCheap signage everywhere and the sides of guac and sour cream are TINY (and cost extra) The food was subpar. The meat was virtually flavorless so my tacos just tasted like Chahula and the extra jalape\u00f1os I added to try to give them some flavor.\nThe service was extremely rude. My friends sat at the table next to us and their 3 year old spilled rice on the floor. The staff kept making comments about how it was \"disgusting,\" etc. (HE'S THREE!)\nAfter our food was served no one came to check on us so eventually I went up to the counter to ask for something. I was told to \"Please go sit down\" in a very condescending manner.\nEXTREMELY disappointing all around. The only reason I didn't give it 1 star is that it was pretty clean. I really wanted to like this place because the people who own it were very accommodating and nice.  But bad food is bad food.  And in this case, it was both meanings of bad.  I ordered a vegetarian burrito and an order of juevos rancheros to go.  The burrito was made from greasy thrown together onions and peppers with a splash of a salsa that tasted like Rotel out of a can.  It was so wet, the tortilla fell apart.  Later that evening, it would also prove to be my Montezuma's revenge.  Maybe jeuvos rancheros isn't the best take out item, but, how do you screw up on eggs?  Mendoza's did.  What was that stuff that was supposed to be a tomato based item?  Only 1/4 was eaten out of hunger.  And yes, a second person became physically ill from this food.  It made for some tense moments in our 1-toilet hotel room. This gabaucho may be a rube when it comes to Mexican food, but for my money, this is the best place in Pittsburgh I'm not sure what happened to this place. My husband and I went there for lunch today because we had eaten there last year and it was fantastic. We lived in FL for a long time and are always searching for Mexican that compares to the Mexican food there. The first time we ate at Mendoza Express it was fantastic, authentic, and reasonably priced. This time it was awful. They have changed everything. They use yellow nacho cheese now. The refried beans are not only no longer mashed, but lacking flavor. There was Parmesan instead of queso fresco on my husband's enchiladas. The food was barely warm. We were the only people there, so it makes no sense. We are so disappointed! What was a diamond in the rough now seems to be a mediocre at best Mexican restaurant. I think they must be doing budget cuts or something....", "stars": 3.5}, "East Liberty": {"year": 2017, "text": "The place is really badly/cheaply decorated, and the lights are WAY too bright. As bright as a Taco Bell. The atmosphere is that of a crappy cafeteria in a historial. The food came freezing cold and it was ok. People were nice, tho. Wanted to give an update since I have returned since my first review. A group of us doing a weekend meditation retreat met up here and I'm happy to report the food was delicious. I was totally pleased. I truly hated leaving that first review--it made me feel like a big jerk. I'm so happy my second experience was so so tasty. Ok, admittedly not a lot of Ethiopian in the Burgh to compare to. But I grew up in the Washington DC area, which did have a lot of Ethiopian. Tana is excellent. Not quite as good as the best in DC, the Red Sea, but very very good. Savory and spicy, all the right textures. The injera was actually better than some I've had before. Prompt friendly service and prices reasonable. Will definitely return! A great new addition to the international food scene. I had to go to Wallace's one more time before I could write an accurate review. I went for a Yelp event, brunch, and now breakfast. The Yelp event was wonderful, so we convinced friends to join us for brunch. The brunch was okay, but wasn't what I wanted. I didn't realize the brunch and breakfast menus were so different and had my heart set on the stuffed French toast. I ended up ordering the seafood omelet and it was mediocre. Nothing else that was ordered at my table was better than okay. All the food was edible and some plates were finished, but it wasn't anything special. \n\nOkay, so I still want to try Wallace's again because my first experience was great. We head there for breakfast. I finally order the stuffed french toast! And agree to split the french toast and a veggie skillet. They're both very good, but smaller than expected. The stuffed french toast is also no longer \"stuffed\" and instead just spread with a strawberry cream cheese. It was very good, but not as good as it had been the night I first tried it. It was a better experience than the time I went for brunch, but again, I don't think it was that special. \n\nI think Wallace's could really benefit from a few changes.  breakfast and brunch menus are ridiculously small to be separate menus and should really be one menu that is available at all time. The service is usually good in the morning, but I did have one or two peculiar interactions. Well stocked grocery store. Lot of organic stuff and nice frozen meals. Helpful staff. We have been here a few times. They have a great selection of oysters. All of the food is amazing. The service is great, we prefer to sit at the bar. We came here on a Saturday, with reservations. We were sat right away. The server was very helpful in explaining the menu and had a vast knowledge of each item. We ended up sharing a seafood tower which, we weren't sure would be enough but it was! It was just the perfect amount without making us too full that we opted for dessert (usually we pass, but it was also my birthday). Each oyster was described to us, all tasting very fresh and distinct from the others based on geographic location. We had the bourbon pecan ice cream for dessert which was house made and amazing. I can't wait to go back! Not many places in Pittsburgh specialize in oysters but luckily Muddy Waters does and knocks it out of the park. Not to mention they have an excellent happy hour with oysters included. Then Tuesdays they do a late night happy hour from 9pm - 11pm. The bubbles are $10.00 off bottles and champagne are $20.00 off bottles. They also have boilermakers on special. \n\nMuddy Waters is my go-to since to me you can't go wrong with oysters and bubbles. \n\nAlso, it has to be mentioned that the staff is lovely, Adam has really hired excellent people. We ate here for my husband's birthday. He loves oysters! The oysters were great! Nice variety. We also ordered 2 entrees. The blackened salmon and BBQ shrimp and grits. Both were awesome and the presentation was amazing! Highly recommend you try this place! The dining experience was nice.  The waiter was patient and nice, even tho he forgot to put in my order and messed up our bill. But I guess he was just having a really long day. So I steal my friends food and still had a pleasant experience. This is another new restaurant in the gentrified east liberty since I lived here. It's not very big so I would recommend making reservations. We came here on Christmas Eve and they had happy hour specials. One of the offerings was $1 oysters with a minimum order of 6. I am not a big oyster eater but YOLO so I ordered them. You can't not order oysters at a restaurant that's known for its oysters lol they were pretty fresh and big. Not as salty or strong tasting. We paired it with their $10 off special of a bottle of bubbly. We got the Italian prosecco. For my entree I got the banana foster french toast sans bacon. It was a nice size portion and very flavorful. I liked the bread they used for the French toast. They also have a Bloody Mary bar during brunch. I don't really like bloody Mary's but it seems like a good deal for $10. I have two great things to say about this place. Food and service. \n\nService...number one: my parents and I popped in here on a Saturday afternoon and I totally did not realize they were closing between lunch/dinner. That didn't stop them from serving us! They did explain that kitchen (hot food) was closed, but raw bar and drinks open. Thanks!!!! (Felt like kind of a jerk once I realized we were in the break time.) \n\nWe ordered the chef's east/west sampler and three cocktails. The server fully detailed the types of oysters displayed (beautifully) and their tastes, regions of origin. Very informally informative. \n\nFrench 75, some bourbon and a Bloody Mary gave those oysters a real pop. \n\nThe atmosphere is totally chill and makes it perfect to relax, imbibe and have some great conversation. \n\nMusic selection was on point! Made my pops pretty happy!\n\nI checked out the Happy Hour menu and it looks fantastic!! $1 and $2 oysters and drink specials. Other items off the raw bar look great too, but it's going to take me a lot to steer from those salty oysters. CAN'T WAIT to return. Went here for the restaurant week special, will definitely be back. bartenders were friendly and one explained one of the specialty cocktails she was making. food was delicious and server was also friendly and funny. all around a good experience. The service was really good, our waitress did a great job explaining the oysters they had on special. Great for happy hour- $1 east coast oysters, $2 west coast. I loved the poboy, and the beignets were yummy. Eh at best. Literally 6 people in the whole place and it took forever to get .... wings and the surf n turf. With that being said, the presentation was definitely reminiscent of my grandma putting food on the plate. You could probably spend a little more time making it pretty. As far as taste goes it was ok. Nothing to write home about but not terrible. Really nothing I consider a draw here. Very over priced for eh. We stoped in for lunch the day after Christmas. The fellow behind the bar was polite, helpful and knowledgeable about the different brews on tap. After some discussion he recommended the Morgantown for me and he was spot on, it was great.\n\nThe kitchen area is in the center of thd bar, the other 2 workers never stoped. It is real wood fire and one guy seemed to be doing prep work and cooking while the other tended to keeping the fire just right (please get the poor guy the ove glove for god sakes) \n\nThe food was delicious although a bit pricey especially for a pub setting but that's the problem I don't think they know what they're trying to be. \n\nIt's actually quite sad this could be a really great  place with just a few minor changes for example: the glass on the exterior should be thoroughly cleaned, Decor should be a little bit more warm and inviting and building some type of Cabinetry around the center kitchen area wouldn't be a bad idea either nobody wants to see a gross looking floor drain in the center of the kitchen while they're eating or dingy metal shelving.  They have all the Necessities for having a great place; good staff, good food and good beer, a few tweaks and this would be our new favorite place. Oh and as we sat there watching the poor bartender have to walk a marathon every time he needed to tend to someone near the front door, I couldn't help but think some type of pass through or walkthrough for them on that side of the bar would be beneficial. Everything was very nice. Loved the simple beautiful decor. The food was delicious and the staff was so helpful! We had duck, venison, scallops, escargot, beets, and rabbit. The only downfall for us was that we are simple folk and had no idea what anything meant. The waiters answered all of our questions though. Still don't know what some of the stuff was though! Attire: I guess jeans are ok, the one kitchen worker (not sure of his title) had jeans on. Again, simple folk. We are not from the burgh so we drove around for 20 min. trying to find a parking spot. Maybe there's a secret but we don't know it!\n* I don't give away 5 stars The food, service and ambiance were all phenomenal. This is the best restaurant I've been to in Pittsburgh Excellent atmosphere, beer selection and food. Tried two of the Dutch beers, onion soup n wild boar meatloaf.\nAll outstanding along with helpful wait staff.\nCan't wait for another trip to Pittsburgh! I love Sharp Edge- it's like my Cheers. Great selection of beers, nice people, good food- the bites are THE BEST. Go for the Jamaican Jerk bites. Also, really great deals at happy hour times and late night (my favorite time to go). The deal on pizzas late night is the best! The mussels are great too. I've tried them all! I think tomato bacon is my favorite. A neighborhood gem in Friendship:) Parking a bit difficult to find, but service and food is good. The menu to this restaurant is short and sweet. The food was amazing. I got the Margherita pizza and the mixed greens salad with arugula, tomatoes, and balsamic. The hot honey is a must to get! Dipping your crust in the honey was the BEST. The restaurant was cozy and the tables were all full. The BYOB was a huge plus, too! I surprised my wife for her birthday by bringing her to the Ace hotel for a night (Thursday-Friday). The surprise was a hit! Ace has a reputation of quality, uniqueness, and design. You get all of those things from the moment you pull up to the front door of this great hotel (former YMCA building). \n\n1. Valet parking - great experience and $25 a night. \n\n2. Lobby - Whitfield restaurant to the left, bar and seating to the right. The Whitfield is extremely good and priced high. The bar is a bar with a happy hour available (4:30pm-6:30pm, daily). The burger is $10 during the happy hour and that's a great deal! Everything is designed smartly in the lobby, and it is a great place to catch up with friends in the evening or to relax and read in the morning. They serve Stumptown coffee (you have to pay for it), which, if you like coffee, is a fantastic coffee roaster. \n\n3. The room - we got the medium size room. Great, great, great design to the room. Bathrobes. Great view. Excellent smelling soap (this is a must for me). Extra things to purchase from the room. Room service, etc. The bed was very comfortable (firmer than most hotels, which I like). Tv was small. \n\n4. Check-in time is 3pm and check-out time is 12pm (I love this later check-out time). \n\n5. Within walking distance to the best restaurants East Liberty has to offer.\n\nThe service at this hotel is great. I let them know the occasion for our stay and there was a handwritten note wishing my wife a happy birthday, 2 free coffee coupons, and a bottle of fancy water (probably harvested from Middle Earth or something). Great experience there. \n\nI gave the hotel 4 stars because, at face value, its priced too high. I reserved a room when there was a promotion and I paid $150 for the medium size room (after taxes and such). You'd probably pay $30ish more on a regular day, and that price isn't worth it to me. It's just not. BUT it seems they run promotions all the time. \n\nStay at the Ace. If you appreciate design and quality service . . . Stay at the Ace. You won't be disappointed. Amazing!  Family style steak - enough said!   This is a carnivore's dream, and all the sides were wonderful too! I went here for a lavish dinner with a big group this past weekend.  The Ace Hotel lobby is cool and a nice place to meet and have a pre-dinner drink but there is no separation between the lobby and the Whitfield so you feel like you are sitting in a hotel restaurant (which is different from the Ace Hotels I have been to in New York and LA where the restaurants are entirely separate spaces from the rest of the hotel).  In terms of the food, the oysters were good but a little small (makes me wonder how good their food sourcing is since larger oysters tend to be more prevalent during the colder months) but the beef tartar was spot on.  For the main course me and my friend split the 32 oz ribeye.  I ordered it rare/medium (as one should do at a fine steakhouse) but unfortunately we both wound up with sour stomachs.  That tends to be a sign that the meat is not particularly fresh (a steak that is top notch can be eaten almost entirely raw and not give you any stomach problem) and was probably frozen before being cooked and served.  For $65 I expect a top notch cut.  Service was also a little spotty. I've been looking forward to dining at Whitfield and after my experience last night, I wish I had not waited so long.\n\nFirst impression...this place is cool. It is the former East Liberty YMCA which has now been converted into the Ace Hotel. Ace is known for it's eclectic hotel renovations and this place lives up to it's billing. The restaurant and bar is located in the lobby of the hotel and the renovations retain virtually all of the features of the building's prior use. They even left the gym alone, other than removing the basketball hoops.\n\nThe bar and restaurant were packed with people. One thing you should be aware of if you are going to dine here is that this place is LOUD. There are virtually no soft surfaces anywhere on the floors or walls and the sound bounces around the place. I personally like that vibe, so it didn't bother me at all. If you're looking for a quiet romantic place for dinner, however, you may want to go somewhere else.\n\nWe had a 730pm reservation and arrived a bit early so we could have a drink before dinner. The bar area has a variety of seating options and the bartenders are excellent. \n\nWe were seated within 10 minutes of our reservation time and our server was prompt and courteous. We were with another couple and the 4 of us ordered 2 38oz Porterhouse steaks to share. We also ordered salads and a few side dishes to accompany our entrees.\n\nThe wedge salad I ordered was perfect and the steaks (cooked perfectly medium rare) and side dishes were also excellent.\n\nHere's why I didn't give this restaurant 5 stars:\n\nWhen we were ordering our steaks, our server told us that there were only 3 left and suggested that he run back to the kitchen to get our order in before they ran out. This resulted in a couple of things I think smart diners should consider in that situation. First, I was curious as to how they were almost out of a most popular entr\u00e9e at 730pm on a Saturday evening. You would think that they would try to have enough on hand to allow most diners to order them throughout the evening.\n\nMore importantly, when the steaks came out to our table, they were extremely fatty. The filet mignon side of the steak was almost all fat with very little meat. I guess that as the chef gets orders for this item during a dinner service the best steaks get selected first and by the time there are only 2 or 3 left they are probably of lesser quality.\n\nThe lesson I learned here is that if you are told that there are only 2 or 3 steaks left, and they cost $80 each, you should ask the server to show you the steaks before they cook them. I'm guessing that I would have selected another entr\u00e9e had I been given that opportunity.\n\nI want to be clear that the steaks were cooked perfectly and were among the best tasting steaks I have ever eaten. I just think that for $80, the steak should be wholly edible and ours were not.\n\nOther than the issue described above, I truly enjoyed my evening at Whitfield. This is a great restaurant and I hope to return soon. I've had several meals here since they opened, both brunch and dinner. Recently had brunch here and it was really good. First, I have to admit that I love the space. Retro-ish, cool and trendy without being obnoxious about it.Very comfortable. And I love that they kept so much of the interior in tact. The huge windows are wonderful. Service is usually good, but can be a bit unenthusiastic depending on the server. Food is very well prepared and creative without being pretentious. Cocktails are also a highlight and they always have something interesting to try. Always enjoy going here ad looking forward to going back. An excellent addition the the East End. Solid 4  the atmosphere here was excellent: intimate, unique, inviting. The service was great, friendly an accommodating... they made my wife and I feel like we'd been there a thousand times even though it was our first. My favorite part of the whole experience is the vibe of the whole building, shared with the Ace Hotel; the bar across the way is lively and sexy, the gym down the hall is fun and casual. Very much a 30s-revival decor. The food was quite good, but I can't say it was the most memorable part of the experience. I'll admit that for the price you get what you'd expect but nothing more. All in all I would love to go back. I went here recently in a weeknight with a  group of 7. The atmosphere is absolutely so cool. Right away our service was slow, getting waters, drinks and pretty slow throughout the dinner. I ordered a bourbon cocktail and it really wasn't that strong. Huge flaw when you can minimally taste the liquor. Our waiter overall was pleasant, just got an attitude once when someone tried to ask him something. I ordered  the duck dish and it was by far one of the best meals I've ever eaten. Everything was perfect. Several people got the short rib dish and were very disappointed - lots of fat they said. One person ordered the steak that the waiter raved about and he said it was definitely a good meal but not as hyped as made out to be. For me though, I will for sure return. I just can't get enough of this place. Have gone a few times now during the week and on the weekend. Great place to have a work meeting, and it feels good to support a local small business. \n\nThe coffee shop is right on Penn Ave and in the heart of East Liberty. As soon as you walk in, you smell their delicious dark roast coffee. I love the smell of it. Totally wish I could pack the scent up in a candle and take it home with me. \n\nWhen I approached the counter to order my coffee, on the countertop were a bunch of delicious and savory eats. I chose to get a green bean casserole puff pastry and an apple cider donut with a small coffee. I was on the fence about ordering the green bean casserole, but my friend that I was with convinced me that it was worth a try. Of course I didn't regret it. Yummmy!!! If the thing wasn't already 5 dollars, I would have gotten another one.  It was delicious, but it was definitely not enough for a meal. The apple cider donut also didn't disappoint. It was moist, sweet, and definitely tasted of apple cider. I would recommend it, emphatically! \n\nAll in all, great experience. Staff is attentive and it's clean.  Check it out! I ordered tea latte and lemon muffins. You can choose your own tea. I like their music and enjoy the free wifi, so I spent my whole afternoon here. Love it!", "stars": 4.1}, "Emsworth": {"year": 2017, "text": "This is my go to place for suds, food and Steeler football.  DELICIOUS food.  One of the best hamburgers, reubens and fish sandwiches around.  Try the smoked wings.  Fast attentive service.  \n\nAlways a good time at Sunnys. Lots of tv's.  Enjoy the 34 foot outdoor tv in the summer!  \n\nThe owner Mike is quite a fixture and character and adds some fun and silliness when he's there....just follow the sound of the booming laughter. \n\nWear your black and gold on game days.  A genuine pittsburgh sports bar  and restaurant.  Ok for kids too!", "stars": 3.0}, "Etna": {"year": 2016, "text": "Wow really? I thought i already reviewed this HORRID pizza shop, guess i forgot to save it. I live right down the street , so i gave this local pizza shop many chances.. Its so bad, makes you wander why the hell people come here... Must be some kind of blind loyalty... Or their customers never tried real pizza.. Its the cheapest ingredients ever... Gross over sauced , no cheese, cracker like cheap dough.. Overpriced garbage. I tried some sandwiches too!  They only thing they got going for them is that they use Mancini's bread... Inconsistent portions, soggy lettuce.. Just save your money and stay away... If i could give negative stars i would.. I enjoyed both the pizza and hoagies this pizza shop offers.  It's a small joint that over the years has stayed true to their roots (for good or bad).  Their pizza is very unique, as the crust is very light and cracker like.  Their hoagies are also good and served on Mancini's bread (which is a plus to anyone from Pittsburgh).  My opinion: This place is worth a visit to try a unique pizza served up the same way since 1954. We just struck pierogi (black) n gold!!! The owner saw us looking in the window on a day they are closed and opened his kitchen to us! Did I mention that I LoVe Pittsburgh people? Sampled the Mac and cheese and Ruben and walked out with 4 dozen!!!!!! BEST pierogis in the burgh! We called ahead for a huge order and they even made a couple custom ones for us. The mac and cheese wasn't my fave but the potato, potato and cheese, bacon, and others were great. Not a lot of seating but it wasn't super busy. Back in town from LA. Was craving good pierogi and haluski and found this spot on yelp. Reasonable prices, an amazingly creative menu, ate in but they have a busy to-go service (testament to their delicious food). Will definitely be back. Step 1: Measure the amount of free space in your freezer.\nStep 2: Drive to Cop Out (with CASH) on one of the days that they're open (Wed, Fri, and Sat).\nStep 3: Eat some delicious prepared pierogies and fall in love.\nStep 4: Buy a huge amount of pierogies that will just barely fit in the carefully measured space in your freezer.\n\nThe reuben and gyro ones were fantastic, perfectly seasoned, and went really well with the provided sour cream. We also tried the jalapeno, potato, and cheese...we enjoyed these, but they were less standout (plenty spicy, though!). The dough was a perfect thickness--just a tiny bit chewy, and nicely steam-fried to crisp perfection.\n\nIf you want delicious, unique (and very affordable!) eats in a place that makes you feel like family on your first visit, head on down to Cop Out! Just a last minute decision to stop for lunch. Best decision of the week. Great Polish platter. And a short walk home. Afternoon may be shot for digestion My husband has wanted to go here for a few years and we finally made it on an anniversary trip into the city. We got lucky cause they had a bag of the pilgrim pierogies. They don't usually have them this time of year.  I wasn't sure about this combo but it was delicious. Had the pepperoni pizza ones tonight for dinner. Awesome also. Can't wait to go back and try the Reuben, Mac n cheese and a few dessert ones. Love this place I read the reveiws I went there because they said they were good... I bought fifty-six pierogies  and they didnt know the meaning of seasoning... Buffalo chicken was fine..mac and cheese know taste at all. Potatoe and cheese awful...Rueben still in freezer haven't tried the potatoes and kraut yet in freezer..The owner was quite pleasant and gave us samples of the Buffalo pierogie and the heath pierogie...they were tasty i was sold... Sorry to say Pierogie Plus is my place.. Incredibly friendly and helpful service combined with delicious pierogies, you really can't go wrong here.\n\nMy favorite pierogies are from Pierogies Plus, however this place sells wonderfully wacky variations and it all tastes great. Pierogies Plus will always be my go-to for authentic fresh pierogies, however Cop Out pierogies are still fun and delicious.\n\nI'm not sure why they sell mostly frozen pierogies, but if you follow their cooking instructions you will turn out with great pierogies.\n\nThey gave me some free samples to try, namely Reuben pierogies. I really recommend the spinach feta, they are great!\n\nThey also sell haluski, which I'd like to sample one day. My husband and I have been wanting to try this place for a long time. We finally decided to get the $20 for $15 deal on YELP and it was fantastic. It appears you can eat in or take your pierogies home and cook them yourself (which is what we decided). From the moment we stepped in the door the woman at the desk was busy, but she was SO helpful. We decided to get the pilgrim (tastes like a thanksgiving dinner), and the hot sausage.. We decided for a while honestly because there's so many types! Both were awesome! We have leftovers still in the freezer to cook for another day, and plan on going back here to try some more. I highly recommend this place! So good! They're just like the pierogi I make with my Polish grandma, with more flavors. We had the chicken parm, pilgrim, potato/bacon/sauerkraut, and fudge. \n\nWatch out for their unusual opening hours and cash only policy, but otherwise it's well worth the drive across town! Handmade perogis to cook yourself. So many choices. Personal Favorite - Mac & Cheese. This is a MUST do if you like Perogis. A little place in Etna we had never heard of, but stumbled on while do some shopping on the street. There are a few tables there, but they seem more set-up for take out. We weren't sure what we wanted, but the people were nice enough to fry up a sample platter of 3 or 4 different ones.  They were all delicious, and we bought 2 bags of frozen ones to take home. The owners are very helpful in giving you cooking instructions if you are not familiar with cooking them. In my opinion, the best pierogies in a town full of them. Also a regular source so you don't have to wait until the local church has their yearly sale.  I haven't tried the dessert ones yet, but the sound very good. This place is the bomb. I thought it was more of an actual restaurant, and less of a take-away-frozen-pierogies kind of place, so when we arrived it wasn't open for dining, but the owner cooked us up some pierogies anyway. The customer service was amazing. He even gave us some free dessert pierogies. There were so many different creative looking flavors...I wish I were able to try more! You can tell the owner is passionate and cares a great deal about the quality of his product. Even if the pierogies hadn't blown my mind, I would return just to support this guy. But the pierogies did blow my mind. Next time I'm in Pittsburgh I'm going to come prepared with a cooler so I can fill it up with these little pieces of heaven. Three-star food with five star service. The quality of the perogies was very good, but they aren't my favorite. The stuffed cabbage had good flavor but lacked sauce volume and appeared to have been microwaved on the reheat. \n\nThe desert perogies were the highlight!  They reminded us of a crab Rangoon :) but in a sweet perogie style. Love, love, love. That is all I can say!\n\nThe service, the food, the pierogies!! All are top notch and I am so glad we came here.\n\nFrom the moment you set foot in the door you are treated as family. We were graciously walked through the menu and my daughter was even taken back into the kitchen so she could fold her own pierogi.\n\nWe tasted the cheeseburger, traditional potato and cheese and the hot sausage. They brought out saut\u00e9ed onions to go along with them which was a great add. My personal favorite was the cheeseburger but some of our group liked the sausage better.\n\nWe ended up getting 12 dozen to go since we loved them all so much, definitely a ringing endorsement for how much this Polish family enjoyed them!! The pierogies were out of this world!!!  And the owner/chef came out to meet us and discuss which pierogies we might like-- and then after we had them (yum!), they told us how to cook them.  We ended up buying 5 dozen and 2 dozen made it back all the way to San Diego, thanks to me finding some dry ice to keep them frozen.  You can't go wrong with this place; just make sure they are open when you are ready to go! WOW to everything. When we went they were actually closed, but the owner had us in and made us food anyway! He also let us sample the peach dessert pierogies. Yum! We got the jalape\u00f1o pierogies with sour cream and onions and ate every last bite. Best meal in Pittsburgh!! Best pierogies in Pittsburgh! I ordered the potato cheese jalapeno pierogies w/ onions and couldn't get enough. Their pierogies will forever have a spot in my freezer, no joke, I will always have a stash. Cop Out is geared towards being a to-go place, especially since the pierogies are frozen and ready for you to take home. They do offer to cook them for you right there (w/ or w/o onions). However, there are only two small tables to sit at. So just as long as no one else beats you to it, you can eat there. But wait! It gets even better... Cop Out is BYOB. Did somebody say six pack and pierogies??\n\nThe selection here is out of this world! Anything you could ever want stuffed inside is available or can be available. They even have numerous dessert pierogies. I tried some samples of a cheesecake version with chocolate frosting and M&M's... O-M-G! Totally exceptional and unlike anything I've had before (more on that later). Cop Out has that awesome mom-and-pop shop vibe. The owner, is a retired police officer, he and his wife were the only ones there working on a Saturday afternoon. The wife was operating the register and taking orders, while her husband was making all the magic happen in the kitchen. Very cool spot, very old school, and so very Pittsburgh.\n\nNow let me tell you about the most exceptional customer service I've ever received in my entire life! It was my first time at Cop Out. Upon entering, the owners wife greeted me and explained the menu. There were a few other patrons she was helping, as well. When I made my decision and finally ordered, she offered me the delicious samples I mentioned earlier! As if that wasn't enough, she boxed up a bunch for me to take home... free of charge. I sat in a high stool in the corner while I waited for my food, the wife chatted to us casually. She told us stories of how she met her husband and a little bit about the business. Her husband brought out some orders and introduced himself to everyone. They were both so friendly. It was a shock... you don't find hospitality like that in too many places these days. (Okay, let's be real... you can't find service like that anywhere.)\n\nThen to top it all off, when my food was ready, as the wife handed me my order, she threw in an additional to-go container. All she said was \"My husband is doing a giveaway\". It was a large container of Haluski, again free of charge! She gave me some basic heating directions and sent me on my way. (When I say large, I mean it fed three adults dinner the following night and of course it tasted amaaaazing!) They left such a great impression on me, I had to share in length how amazing they were. \n\nPlease go here and meet them for yourself! Sooooo Good! I came in 4 minutes to close and they were super nice to me. Lol. It looks like a Lil mom and pop joint, real cozy and laid back. A bunch of list of perogi on the counter when I walked in. I could of spent 80 bucks easily in that place. Everything looked really good, and it was! I took home some bomb stuffed cabbage, not just regular old stuffed cabbage either. This stuffed cabbage was a 9.8 good. Probably the best one I've ever had, and I've had quite a few. \n\n Now to the perogi. I bought 2 bags (and the stuffed cabbage) for 20 or 25 bucks. Mac and cheese, and chicken marsala. She gave me a half dozen (at least) extra of a another flavor potato bacon blue cheese FOR FREE because I'd never been there, and they were spectacular. I brought it all home and made the PBBC. Mmmwah soooo perfect. I posted a pic of them with onions saut\u00e9ed in butter and cottage cheese on the side (that's the way I eat all perogies) u should try it as a topping. I will go back and I would suggest yinz check it aaht*\n\n*out in Pittsburghese The planets must have been aligned today as I was lucky enough to be at Cop Out pierogies while they were open.  I ordered a dozen hot sausage and a dozen reuben (frozen) to have later with dinner.  Well we just got finished eating and Wow....  I have made, bought, and eaten my fair share of pierogies over the years and these were some of the best.  I got to talk with the owner while I was there and he seems like a great person.  In fact he gave me half of his own sandwich as a sample of what he will be serving.  I will definitely be a returning customer, as the food is great and the owner is one hell of a stand up guy. You have so many different choices of piergoies! Amazing food and friendly people! At least try it out I used to go here all the time when I was pregnant.  The perogies are awesome.  Totally diverse menu- bacon and blue cheese perogies???!!! Come on- of course they are good. This place was tiny.  Just a three little tables, but the chef and his wife are warm, friendly, and full of humor!  The food was delicious.  The buffalo chicken pierogies were delicious, and the price is remarkably low for the quality of the food.  Our pierogies were served with a side of grilled onions and sour cream-as all pierogies should be served.  I only wish this place was closer to home!! Friendly service like family.  Generous portions.  Creative and tasty offerings.  Pierogies have often been underserved even in Pittsburgh.  Cop Out Pierogies is serving up justice to the polish dumplings with a variety of unique and delectable fillings! Fantastic people AND fantastic food! My husband introduced me to pierogies a long time ago. How can I ever eat frozen pierogies again? So spoiled now! This will be a must-stop every time we are in Pittsburgh. This is my first time eating Luca's and I was disappointed. Not sure if we got a bad batch of sauce or dough but it was waaaay too salty. Hard to eat. Plus it wasn't even hot at all. Barely warm... I also got hot wings which were not spicy at all and soggy (breaded wings). I asked for diet Pepsi and got regular. Order ONLINE AT YOUR OWN RISK!!  First and last time I will ever order from them. I ordered online at 409pm. 520pm rolls around, no pizza. I call and the guy asks for my phone # then says the driver left with it and he will call to see what's up. 20 more minutes pass, now it's been 1.5 hrs so I call again. The guy asked for my address and says he doesn't have an order for me. I said, \"you asked me for my # 20 min ago when I called and you said the guy was out with it\" Then he says, \"I don't know WTF is going on\". He proceeds to say \"F*&k\" about 5 more times. He calls someone and explains what is going on with my situation and argues with someone. Then he gets back to me and says he can make my food and have it delivered soon. After his unprofessional \"F BOMBS\" I declined. Not a good way to run a business. Hell, at least offer me a free pizza or something for all the trouble. But nope, nothing, just \"What the f*^k\", \"F*&k\", \"This is f*&king ridiculous\". HIGHLY ENCOURAGE NOT ORDERING FROM THEM UNTIL THEY GET THEIR ACT TOGETHER!! Perfectly crisp golden-brown fried fish. And a lot of it. Shrimp are good too. Highly recommended! Delicious fish sandwiches and wraps. Good array of beer choices; draft and bottle. The bar area is small and not too crowded when the games are on, which is nice. I can't speak to their famous fried fish (as I have yet to have it), but their chicken tenders are quite delicious.  I've gotten platters of them when entertaining and they are always a hit!  There is never one left, even when it's just a group of adults.  Very affordable and good quality. Came here two Friday nights in a row for their Lenten dinner specials - yes, the fish sandwiches are THAT good. This place was packed both nights, and the number of take out orders leaving this restaurant was crazy! I couldn't believe how much food they were pumping out of that kitchen. I'm so glad this place is close - less than 10 minutes from our house - a solid neighborhood find. The service was friendly (although a bit slow as they were VERY busy on the Lenten Fridays we were there) and our food was good and came out hot. The fish was REALLY good and HUGE portions. The sandwich comes with two giant fillets, fries, coleslaw and a bun to make a sandwich with. I also tried the shrimp platter - it was generous too and the shrimp tasted good, was hot and was crispy being breaded in Panko. It was however, VERY greasy. I think I will stick to the fish as the Lenten dinners go. We tried the fried apps as well - hush puppies, jalapeno poppers and their house made cheese sticks. All of these were just OK - pretty clearly just freezer to fryer stuff, but it wasn't bad for the price. The house made cheese sticks were crispy on the outside - not breaded. They were also just OK. Other sides we tried were the mac and cheese and haluski. The mac and cheese was almost overwhelmingly buttery - more like  buttered macaroni noodles with some cheese, rather than a macaroni and cheese with a cheese sauce that may have had some butter in it. It was just OK - it was a lot of butter for me. The haluski was also OK, but pretty tasty. Definitely worth at least one Lenten Friday trip! We will be back to try their other \"non-Lenten\" dinner options soon enough, I'm sure. Always love a good neighborhood find! solid little place, really good burgers and fries. not that exciting selection of beers but if you aren't too picky it's more than fine.  Staff are super nice and personable . it's clean and not too loud at all. Always great service and food. Their fish sandwiches are amazing along with their chicken tenders. I always sit at the bar and the service is quick! Outstanding little joint with friendly staff, fast service and great food. Their fish sandwich's are amazing, you really get your money's worth here.  This place is worth a visit when your in the area. It's official. ETOWN may very well offer the best fried fish in pittsburgh. While ETOWN is more a bar than restaurant, it is impeccably clean, bright and NS. Service is friendly, several beers on tap and daily specials. But fried fish is their thing, and they do it right. Flat fillets fried in a crunchy batter, drained from excess grease and served piping hot with tasty french fries and a small container of house made slaw. Fish sandwiches are served on a kaiser roll. \n\nI've been searching for Pittsburgh's best fried fish for 25 years.  I've narrowed it down to ETOWN for the traditional and Pipers Pub for the beer batter style. \n\nEAT LOTS OF FISH.... Great little dining room in the back- go for fish sandwiches.  Wait staff is super efficient and very friendly. I walked into this place with some friends and wasn't sure what to expect. The location and parking situation isn't the best. You walk in and there is the bar area. Keep walking through to the back room and there are about 10 tables. We ordered the chicken finger platter. I have to say that it was the best chicken fingers I've ever had. The best way for me to describe it is like long john silver breading without any grease. This isn't something I would normally order, but I heard they were known for the fish and chicken so I had to try it. I got 5 large pieces of chicken, fries and coleslaw for $7.99. My daughter and I shared it and we still couldn't finish everything. The cost for the quantity and quality is amazing. I will 100% be back to eat the chicken. I used to order from this place all the time.  The last 3 orders were garbage.  Bland and flavorless.  It's almost as if they have a Jekyll and Hyde chef duo; one time it's tasty, the next is horrible.  I finally threw the menu away and I am sorry to see you go HKT.  Two stars because you used to have good food in the past.  Now...not so much. Hong Kong Taste is a Chinese food joint where you are going to get a lot of food for not a lot of money. It won't be the best Chinese food you've ever had, but you will get a lot of it. Decided to try Hong Kong Taste out today.  I ordered the sweet & sour chicken, vegetable fried rice, and an egg roll.  Everything tasted bland and had a soggy texture to it. Was it edible? Yes, but not enjoyable at all.  I don't think I will be ordering from here very often.  I don't recommend a visit if you can help it. I have been ordering from this place regularly for at least 5 years. Their Lunch Specials are great...decent sized portions of: meat(s) of your choice, white or fried rice, choice between 3 soups, a crab Rangoon, and an egg roll for around $7...can't beat that! Delivery was always on time, usually early.\n\nHowever...they have recently changed their menu without updating the website. So all of those lunch specials that we loved so much are either gone or different. And unfortunately the staff isn't equipped to make suggestions on similar items when you try to place an order.\n\nSo, if you try to order from there, make sure you have an orange menu, not the green one!!!\n\nEven with today's not-having-the-right-menu disappointment, still one of my favorite places for quick, cheap, always delicious Chinese food!", "stars": 4.4}, "Friendship": {"year": 2017, "text": "Likely the best Korean place in Pittsburgh, though I'm not sure how much that means.  I've been here twice now, and the food is generally decent, but the service is often uncomfortable.  The waitstaff is uncharacteristically white for a Korean joint, and the servers I've interacted here have great, even when I asked for a bajillion refills on their very aromatic hot tea.  In my defense, the cups are tiny, leaving the tea to get cold in 2 minutes flat if you don't chug it.  A teapot or carafe with the order, like Chinese places do, would be much appreciated.\n\nThe less nurturing service comes from who I think might be the owners.  While we were waiting at the door, two tables opened up at the same time, as an older Korean lady seated played hostess.  As it was a sub-freezing January night, I asked if we could have the table in the back, farther from the constantly opening front door.  I was told simply, \"No.\"  Oh, okay then.  We sat at our door-adjacent table, where we placed our orders and did not receive banchan until well after our entrees were delivered.  It was as if we were being punished for only ordering entrees--\"No appetizers?\" she had asked us, in a tone of half disgust and half dismissal.  Lucky for them though, because I was brought the wrong order, and probably would have been already elbow deep in it when they unceremoniously whisked it away five minutes later if I hadn't been dutifully awaiting my banchan for the full dining experience.\n\nAnyhow, when I did receive my GALBITANG (extra spicy), it was a generous bowl of savory broth, with the perfect level of spice (aka really frickin' spicy without killing my tastebuds just yet), 3 or 4 meaty chunks of short rib bones, and perfect strands of swirled egg.  Overpriced, yes, at around $16, I believe, but deeply satisfying.  My husband's BEEF BULGOGI, was fairly standard (and also overpriced at $22+) but delicious nonetheless--thinly sliced beef, not too fatty, grilled in a sweet and savory sauce that I would eat on anything.  Its accoutrements were mixed up in the banchan we eventually received, but we ate in lettuce cups with rice, grilled onions, sweet pickled onions, and little dabs of doenjang.  Jalape\u00f1os would have completed the perfect bite, but now I'm just getting picky.  Our friends' sizzling plates of BEEF and CHICKEN BOKKEUMBAP were less impressive looking, but as first-time Korean food-imbibers, they seemed to enjoy them.  Spicy sweet pickled cucumber, soybean sprouts, soft marinated eggplant, and kimchi banchan rounded out our meals.  Thinly sliced, well-seasoned cucumber were a stand-out favorite.  The kimchi was seriously disappointing to both kimchi-lovers at the table, myself included.  Other tables adjacent to us received different banchan, some more appealing-looking, but by this point, I was too jaded by rejection to ask.\n\nI enjoyed this meal as much as our previous visit, when our table of four shared a SEAFOOD JUNGOL, filled with squid, monkfish, shellfish, and other sea critters, as well as some sliced veggies, if I remember correctly.  Cooked tableside, it was a fun meal to share, and makes for a spicy, communal dinner experience.\n\nNak Won continues the Asian restaurant trend of tasty food and terrible service, and overpriced to boot if you happen to be in Pittsburgh.  Makes me second guess my Korean cravings.  I think I'll hold out for greener, tastier, friendlier pastures. Good food, terrible service. We were treated as though we weren't paying for our food at all. Will not return because of how impossible it was to resolve issues that should not have arisen at all. We were given much less food than we ordered, and were given no respect, despite paying for our food and leaving a tip that was not deserved. Nak Won Garden (NWG) is pretty good. This was my third or fourth time there and it's been consistently good. The latest trip was for lunch, which is usually when I go and there's maybe two other occupied tables around that time. I've never had to wait to be seated so the fact that they don't do reservations isn't an issue for me. It's a good time to go for a casual lunch because you don't feel like you're occupying other people's space given that their tables are fairly close together. \n\nEach time I've gone they've had Kpop playing (Super Junior, etc.) and it's a very casual environment. I've only been there during lunch hours so there's usually only one person greeting and taking orders. They usually seat you closer to the door/windows which is fine. The waitress was very sweet and they're pretty good about checking in on you without seeming overbearing but also very present if you need anything. It's the perfect combination. \n\nThe food is really good. I usually bring new people who have never had korean food before so they generally get the bibimbap. I like it as well, although I've tried a few other things there. Most recently, I got the Dolsot (hot stone) Bibimbap with chicken and my friend had the marinated beef. Both were good but it's pretty mild without their spicy sauce which I assume is some kind of gochujang. They both had the traditional fried egg served on top, which I love runny. It's $14.99 which honestly isn't bad. They do have bibimbap for less that is not served in the hot stone. This last time they served less side dishes but in larger portions which was totally fine. The kimchi was great. The Mochi ice cream was divine. Everything was good. I've never had their BBQ or their Bulgogi but that's next on my list. I already have plans to go again after friends saw some of my pictures. Also, order the dumplings--it's a must. \n\nI will say that they try to sell you on appetizers which is fine because they're worth it. My friend and I were going to split mochi ice cream (they come in a set of 2) but she just brought out 4-- we didn't complain. We both walked out spending $25-30. This Aldi's has everything you need. The produce was fresh, and the aisles were clean! I also like that they have a garage where you can park your car. It makes me feel a bit safer. \n\nThese prices are unbeatable. They didn't have a ton of people working at the store. And the lines appeared really long, but to my surprise, the wait to check out was pretty short. The Cashier was quick and nice. \n\nI had my 3 month old with me, so I was taking forever to load the belt for checkout, but the staff was nice and didn't make me feel rushed. That felt good. Wow. The food at this place is AMAZING! Their menu changes all the time, and I highly recommend ordering a bunch of things and sharing. Drinks are BYOB.", "stars": 3.7}, "Garfield": {"year": 2017, "text": "Loved this place, came religiously. Was excited to bring out of town family next month just so they can taste the vegan sandwich but with the nearly 5 dollar increase for a whole sub I don't plan to return again. Add to that they were empty so I'm guessing the usual crowd feels the same way. Seems like different people working there too. We go to Spak all the time and their food has always been great. They have many good vegan options and all of them are tasty. Their vegan pizza is way above any other similar offerings in the east end.\n\nThey would have gotten 5 stars two weeks ago. Unfortunately their prices have gone WAY up, maybe for 2017? We order the same set of items almost every time and the total went up 53% from the last time we ordered there! I was shocked. There's no way we'll order from there as much as we used to (I'd say twice a month). It really seems like a boneheaded decision to raise it so much so quickly. Raised their prices on the great Seitan pittsburgh steak sandwich by 39%.  What would have cost me $24 today was going to cost $36.  F that...I won't be back.  Let the newbie fruitcakes, having slunk out of the bay, frolicking around in that perimeter pretending to be in a BS gentrified area, shimmy down there. Spak had in my opinion one of the greatest vegetarian sandwiches I've eaten, anywhere, even in San Fran and Portland - the seitan steak Pittsburgh style. \nI would go out of my way to get it, really, we live over an hour away. .\n\n- until yesterday that is.\n\nI called to place an order for 2 Pittsburgh seitan steak hoagies and an order of seitan wings to go. The lady on the other end of the phone tells me its going to be over $36 . \nI hung up, perplexed at this absurd total my husband and I came to discover that Spak brothers has raised their prices by about 40% ??!! \nNaturally we called back immediately and canceled that order. \nWhat a huge disappointment this business has turned out to be.\n The price on the wings has doubled too. In this day and age people talk, leave reviews ect and I guarantee they will lose a lot more customers beside my husband and I due to this insane price hike. \n\nMaybe its all the haggard, brain dead Californians moving into the ghettos of pittsburgh, desperately trying to gentrify these miserable little crud hole sub divisions of Yinzerville, - these Google types have a tendency to ruin everything their domicile's come into close contact with. . \nThat's why everyone's rent is sky high now. \n\nMakes sense that spak may hike their prices up to appease the bearded yuppies, hipsters, and man- bun types who love to pay west coast prices for a silly little vegan sandwich in \"Da Ghetto\" .\n\nSad. Best of luck spak. But you lost business and not just mine, that I guarantee. Godspeed, Spak Brothers.\nDid their rent increase? Price of food? Some explanation for the 35%+ price increase might help me order again. No more Italian sausage sub? Probably not. Went to the lunch buffet. Its $10 and worth the price. Since I'm a novice when it comes to Indian food, I stuck with the meat selections and rice. The food was good and the waitress was nice. Very nice casual place. Good buffet with some good options. A good place to go for a casual lunch. Stumbled upon Mixtape last night while on a date.  It was the best!!!!  The most comfortable seating I have ever experienced, and my drinks were the best. The atmosphere was very relaxing and fun. So pleased to see how vegan friendly they are.  The staff was super friendly,  too!  And I'm pretty sure my date was more into the marshmallows that garnished our drinks than me! ;) Pho Minh is my neighbor! I must say i consider it one of the perks of where i live. I can remember some cold winter days driving home from work late at night, and calling in, most likely to be their last order. They always came through with one of my favorite winter comfort foods, their Special Spicy Soup. It's a good unpretentious place for locals to eat. We live just around the corner and waited way too long to come here. Tiny cash only spot that is full of delicious snacks. We got rare beef pho, grilled chicken and rice and also some pork spring rolls. The tea and warm food was all perfect and quickly prepared on a cold day. Im excited to return and try more things on the menu. This place is a gem, go check it out! Great food,  great price,  very friendly and accomidating staff.  We had some special requests due to my son's health problem and they made his food exactly as we asked and were very willing to help. New in town.  Saw this place on Google Maps...  now, when I see 'BFG', I instantly think of Doom II (which has absolutely nothing to do with this place, but it caught my eye).  When I saw that they had gyros, I had to check it out.\n\nI ordered a cheeseburger and a classic gyro*.  Both were good, and the gyro had a generous amount of meat compared to other places I've tried in the are so far.  In short:  good food, great prices.  The man who served me, who may have been the owner (I was too hungry to be chatty), seemed a very pleasant individual.  Seating was ample, atmosphere was comfortable, and they offered me water, which I did want but forgot to ask for.  No complaints.  I highly recommend eating here.  I will be back to try the pizza, and of course have more gyros.\n\n*Note - a cheeseburger AND a gyro would probably be too much food for most people at a single sitting.  The portions are not small, I just have the capacity to eat a lot.", "stars": 4.1}, "Greenfield": {"year": 2017, "text": "We used to love Hough's.  It used to have excellent food, prompt waitstaff and a great atmosphere.  Over the past year or two, it has declined to a shadow of its former self. It's loud, crowded, the waitstaff have pitiful customer service and the food was just sad. \n\nOur order consisted of a plate of nachos with cheese, pico de gallo and green onions and an order of apple pie pierogies with a side of ice cream.  They were out of apple pie pierogies, and the waitress didn't ask if I wanted  something else, before leaving.  The nachos arrived, the cheese was like cheese sauce, but cold. The \"pico de gallo\" was basically diced tomatoes and a couple of chives.  It was dry, bland and boring.  \n\nHough's, you've done better.  You've been going downhill for a long time, and this is the last time my fanny will grace one of your seats.  We've tried and tried to give you a chance to redeem yourselves, and we keep getting disappointed. According to a friend with me, her mushroom and Swiss burger was divine. My Cuban was ok. It was a bit dry and could have used some more mustard. That said, tator tots helped make up for it. I was excited at their beer selection and I enjoyed my lambic. Our server was friendly, but drinks went unfilled. Stopped by when I was in the area and overall it was average. The beer selection was decent, nothing crazy and they were missing out on some of the big name breweries. I ordered the chicken tacos. They were quite bland, the pico had no flavor, and sour cream, cheap cheddar cheese, and iceburg lettuce were the only toppings. My girlfriend had an order of perogies. They were tasty and nicely crisp. The service was okay. The food came fast, but the dessert took a while. There are far better tap rooms in the area. First, it says they're open until 10pm. I guess they need to change the website and sign on the door to \"we close whenever we feel like it.\"\nAs I was walking up to it tonight at 9:24, they had the door locked and were turning off the lights. I guess 10 is not when they close...\nLast time I went, I wanted their special Reuben, and they had no Rye buns for it, in the middle of the afternoon. The time before, I wanted a Reuben, but they had no corned beef, again in the middle of the day.\nIt must be nice to remain operating when they're always out of something and close whenever they feel, totally disregarding the signs in the windows say...\nI guess I'll be getting sub's from either Subway in downtown, or better yet, DiBella's, from now on. Remember the little neighborhood Italian restaurant in the old neighborhood you knew you could always stop by for a square meal? The place with the pizza the eggplant parm and the wine beer and full bar? Dinner salads garlic bread and most classic Italian American entrees? Add on bar standards plus huge deli sandwiches and fresh cut fries, yeah, kinda like that... Servers amazingly friendly;  kitchen on point, you can even use your card to pay in this joint! Wheezy? No problem in here, you'll find nobody smoking while you're drinking your beer. Yup smoke free and takes plastic!! A Greenfield Run Gem! We like it so much we've gone over and over again! The bartenders are the coolest. Just be sure to arrive hungry, you'll have leftovers if you don't share with a buddy! Had breakfast here with my husband and stepdaughter for the first time this morning. I pass it every morning on my way to work and have been wanting to stop... but always in a hurry :)\n\nThis is a great place to take a few minutes to slow down.

The restaurant itself is quite old and run down. Could use a freshening up. The floors were quite dirty and everything seemed out of place. The hostess could have cared less that we were interested in a table. The hesitated to \"bother finding us one\". After ordering 3 different drinks off of their menu, the server could only offer me one. The server we had was DAVE. He himself is spectacular, makes you feel comfortable and welcomed, kudos to him!A genuinely sweet man who gives you his honesty. For appetizer he chose the calamari. Highly recommend! The breading is perfect and crunchy, with a tangy sweet Asian glaze and a wasabi type dip. We also ordered the French onion soup which I returned back to the kitchen. The broth had a creamy strange twist that I couldn't swallow. For entree I ordered the angus burger. Very interesting, it was topped with pulled pork. Quite tasty except even though I ordered medium rare the meat was burnt beyond edible. Fianc\u00e9 order chicken sandwich and it lacked any seasoning. Overall the place is good if you just want to catch the game on their many large screen TV's but as for food, the entrees are overly prices for low quality. Since the Boston Market on Washington road closed, we had to venture out to the one in green tree. I ordered the chicken pot pie which also came with cornbread. We also got some of their rotisserie chicken and sides such as sweet corn, creamy spinach, mashed potatoes, and stuffing. \n\nThe pot pie crust was nice and flaky but the filling was just ok. Could have used some more seasoning. A plus though is they use shredded rotisserie chicken in the filling. The rotisserie chicken is always perfectly cooked and yummy. A favorite of mine since childhood. I always love their creamy spinach. Their mashed potatoes are nothing special. The sweet corn is also a great side. \n\nOverall, for the price the quantity and quality of food is pretty good. Can't complain 3.5 stars. The food was fine; it's Boston Market- it's predictable. However, I don't think I've ever had such terrible service as I did from Shiree. I do not have unrealistic expectations for fast food service, but I can't believe how rude and impatient and short with me she was. I am a polite and reasonable customer, and I am appalled that she treated me like that. Everyone has bad days, but her rudeness was totally uncalled for. I hope that the managers will consider holding their employees to a higher standard.", "stars": 3.0}, "Hazelwood": {"year": 2016, "text": "10/16/2016 we purchased a keg for a party. The pump didn't work. When we brought it back to the place the staff told us we were the problem and the pump was fine. They said we over pumped the keg. Extremely rude. When tapped with new pump beer flowed fine. Find somewhere else to buy your beer. I want to like Jozsa Corner, but the disorganized owner makes it hard to like. He seems a lovely guy and he is running the kind of business he dreamed of running. The food is pretty darn authentic, and when a dish is a hit, it really is a hit. It tasted a lot like my Polish and Slovenian family's cooking.\n\nThe challenge comes in making reservations and restaurant planning. When we visited, he kept asking our party where the rest of us were, and complaining that we didn't tell him people weren't coming. This was pretty confusing, seeing as we had told him the exact number of people who came. The charming guy we had read about in reviews was replaced with someone who was clearly angry, and he did not even enter the dining room except to deliver more food. At the end of our meal, Alex came into the room and proceeded to berate the member of our party who made the reservation, telling him that it was very rude to lie and say more people were coming, and that he had made far too much food as a result. He went so far as to suggest we ought to pay for the extra servings. Our host tactfully asked him to go to the other room to discuss it, and the two of them were gone for some time. Eventually, they both came back in and Alex apologized. Apparently he had mistaken our party for another reservation that was twice as large coming the next day. He spent the whole night being resentful towards us for his own mistake. I am sure we would have had a lovely time should that mistake not have happened, but suffice it to say we have not come back. If you're going to go, be sure to call a couple of days before to verify that he has everything right. Yes. Yes. Yes. Disclaimer: you have to understand that you're in for a truly unique and cultural experience if you make a reservation to eat here. If you're looking for quick in and out dining with no flavor, hit up the Olive Garden.\n\nAlex is the owner and chef who is in his mid-70s and is a Hungarian refugee. He will share his experiences with you throughout the night and will welcome you with open arms! He is nothing if not kind. We made our reservation two weeks in advance and he called at least three times to ensure that everything was still on. He said to come hungry, and he wasn't kidding. Seven courses of delicious food in a unique family-type atmosphere. This restaurant is a true gem and I can't wait to return and share this experience with more family and friends. I can't believe there would be any negative reviews on this place. I called 2 weeks ago to make reservations during the week. Alex called me back immediately and confirmed the following:\n\n* Must have 4 or more people\n* $25 cash only\n* If you want to drink, bring your own booze!\n* Come hungry\n\nThere are 2 main tables in the dining area. We had a group of 6 and we sat next to a group of 15 (which included the mayor who is a frequent visitor). It reminded me of having dinner at my grandparents place. Very family friendly, and Alex told us stories of how he was a war refugee to how he started this restaurant. \n\nOn to the food...It was DELICIOUS. There were 7 courses - which were spread out very nicely. Don't expect to be in and out of this place in 30 minutes. It's an experience and is perfect to bring a large group of friends together for a cultural themed environment.\n\nAlex offered us all leftovers on our way out, so you definitely get your moneys worth.\n\nI HIGHLY recommend checking this place out. Have we all been in a situation when we have to make a choice between taking something good on one side and receiving something bad on the other side that goes along with good.  And we weigh in, maybe we say it is not worth it and pass, and sometimes we just plunge in, enjoy good and deal with bad later. \nJozsa Corner is that kind of restaurant that will give you so much pleasure but also give you some reasons to think about what you just did.  My rating is 4 stars for the overall experience and food quality.\nIt is definitely an adventure, starting from the location in Hazelwood, an old building with the sign, \"Traditional and Improvisational Hungarian Cooking.\"  You get in, and somehow,  that old building transforms to be even older and you pass the warm kitchen while stew  in the old pots is boiling and spreading nice smell thru out the space. You are headed next to the literal a-hole-in-the-wall (see picture).  If the cleanliness is a deal breaker, this may not be place for you.  I will quote Lemony Snicket and say, \"...so if you have any sense at all you will put this book down and pick up another one.\"  Nothing is sparkling clean in Jozsa Corner and the toilet is the worst toilet ever - you have to go to a basement, pass some pipes and close the flimsy door that leaves an inch of space between your privacy and the rest of the world. There's no menu; the owner just starts bringing out dishes,\"\nI have to say that all food was exceptional.  You will definitely get many courses of delicious food that contains red paprika and black pepper spices.  Make sure that you get drinks with you as you tend to care less about dust when you had a couple glasses of wine with a great 6 course meal that will not disappoint.\nThis is not a place where you would wear the high heels or a tie - but you may.  This is a place where you will experience the Hungarian adventure in the communal dining atmosphere. Absolute worst restaurant I've ever been too, if you want to even call it a restaurant. I'm happy to provide an honest review...not sure what kind of crack the other positive reviewers were smoking.\n\nI knew this was a dive, hole in the wall, traditional fair type of placing going in, but certainly didn't expect what I encountered..I was attending a party or I would have ran out the door. \n\nOne positive thing, the owner Alex was nice and hospitable and trying to keep tradition alive, but nice doesn't excuse filth. Bathroom squaler. Toilet paper has 1 inch dust and dirt on it.\n\nIt's one small room with a table, family style..okay, that would be okay. Thick dust on everything, cob webs, tons of flys, hot and muggy, dusty decor, tablecloth was a $1 plastic cover that has probably been reused well over 50 times, holes, and literal dirt, hair, old food dried up..I am not exaggerating! I can't even believe they wouldn't put a clean cloth on table with a new party. The dishes were disgusting, had to clean the glasses with the pitcher of water..probably bacteria laden. I'm guessing I'll be sick tomorrow.\n\nI personally didn't think the food was good, but not sure if maybe it was in fact traditional..but not good or worth the money. Some type of crap bread, the meat super cheap cuts, halushki okay, but hard to mess up noodles..dessert was same as app bread but with powder sugar, gross.\n\nI feel so ripped off and pissed, I am truly the dumbass for eating here..but didn't want to be rude and leave my friends party..This place is just comical, can't even believe it is in business..no way do they pass health codes, NO WAY.\n\nI get kitchy, I get nieche, but this is just not worth it. Trust me. We recently visited Jozsa's Corner, and we were not disappointed.   You get a seven course meal (and most dishes will come with \"seconds\").  Don't expect anything fancy in the way of atmosphere, but you will feel \"at home,\" which is more important.  Alex is a very nice man, and an even better cook.  We started with the best bread I have ever eaten with fried mushroom garnish.  The next few courses consisted of Halushki (sp?), which was great, a Hungarian dish consisting of sauerkraut, pork, sour cream and other ingredients, Chicken Paprikash, and a cucumber salad.   Last course was a fried dough-type of dessert.  Everything was very good, and again, most dishes came with \"seconds,\" if so desired. \n\n\"Appointments\" or \"Reservations\" are recommended.   \n\nI would have given five stars with two exceptions:\n\n1.  I thought dessert was lacking.  Although very good.  It did not amount to much other than fried dough with strawberries placed on top.   \n\n2.  I was told on the phone $20.00 per person, and then when we were done with the meal, it was \"$25.00\" a person and it was NOT clear if that included gratuity or not.  A little \"iffy\" on details.   I did not mind paying the $25.00 if it included gratuity, but I felt a little \"blind-sided.\"  \n\nAgain, would definitely recommend, but call a week or two in advance, and BYOB (including soft drinks, tea, etc.).  You are served only water. Is this place out of business? I called and left messages multiple times to make \"an appointment\" with no return call. A truly unique Pittsburgh dining experience. Look beyond the paper plates and styrofoam cups. Who cares sbout that when you are being served delicious homemade Hungarian foof from the owner, Alex.  The atmosphere is great. You are eating dinner in someone's home. The seven course dinner was out of this world. We all left stuffed! Alex is an engaging and eccentric individual and one of the nicest guys out there.  This is not your typical dining experience, so if you are looking for high class dining, go elsewhere.

Not bad, and I appreciate that there's coffee available a few minutes' walk from where I'm staying.  I ordered a large coffee and a fruit tart, which was over $7.  Kinda pricey for what you get.  The coffee was ok - nothing exceptional (I drink it black).  The fruit tart looked great, but it was bland.  \n\nThe atmosphere was not bad at all.  The staff was very friendly.

I'd go back for coffee if I needed a quick caffeine fix and was in the area, but I wouldn't go out of my way.\n\nI'm sure for some people who like specialty coffee drinks, they probably make 'your drink' just the way you like it - they must, with all the glowing reviews they have on here.  My review is based on black coffee and a pastry. Love it there so much. I miss Japanese food and here make me feel satisfied. I'll definitely go back. The waiter is really friendly too. I was thrilled with my experience here! I will start off by saying it's somewhat rare i give 5 stars on yelp. The moment i walked in i felt welcome, and the atmosphere was perfect. They seated my party in the back at a  private/comfy table. The server was great, and attentive. The food? My brother who was a somewhat known butcher in Pittsburgh(and a hell of a cook in my opinion), we always discussed the intrinsic quality of food. That when you eat a meal, you can certainly pick apart and quantify every aspect of the meal, but when something is awesome you know it immediately. Every appetizer, entree, and Sake was that way here. You must get some Sake if you drink, and take an Uber!(I really regret not doing so) I'm used to not really feeling comfortable enough to really drink, but this is a delightful place to catch a buzz. I ordered the okonomiyaki which i would recommend. Teppanyaki Kyoto is my happy place. The takoyaki balls, okonomiyaki, and unagi don are my favorites. This place is authentic, delicious, and has a great atmosphere. I'm looking forward to visiting again soon for my birthday! I've been eating at this beaut of a restaurant two or three times per year for the past 5-6 years, and it's always outstanding. We live in the DC area, and while the DC area has its share of top-notch eateries, none of them have anything on Chef Joseph's always packed and remarkably consistent culinary gem.\n\nThe servers are always professional with just the right touch of friendliness without being too much a part of the dining experience.  The drinks are crafted perfectly.  You never get the bum rush, but you're not sitting there wondering where the food is.  The timing is perfect.\n\nWhat I admire most about this restaurant at this point is its consistency. So many places start out gangbusters, wowing diners and professional reviewers for a year or so only to slowly wallow in their success and bit by bit see a reduction in quality of food, service and ambiance.  \n\nNot this place!  Mr. T himself is almost always manning the kitchen, and the results are evident in the sublime cuisine you enjoy.  My mouth is drooling just thinking of his sublime stuffed peppers appetizer.  Do yourself a favor and splurge on a wonderful dinner/dining experience. Make a trip to Highland Park after reading all the reviews last Wednesday. My gal was home from college and loves a good burger.  Got there when they open at 5:00.... walked to the back of the pub to then only see that they are closed u til January 3rd.  Nothing noted on their FB site or anything.  With the week between the holidays being prime restaurant time in the burg....we were disappointed. At least post a notice on your FB page .....we may try again but not good communication. Literally as good as it gets! So thankful that I tried this place, it just took over the top spot on my Best Pittsburgh Burger list. Seriously, perfection. \n\nIt was a little hard to find. Not marked well. Park Place Pub is the right spot, don't get deterred by the lack of signage. It's located in the back of the bar. It's a separate business in the same room and you're welcome to grab drinks from the bar, which makes it even better. A nice cold draft beer and delicious burger. Does it get any better? Super casual vibes, two big TVs at each end of the bar, and a really great local hangout feel.\n\nI had the Bison Burger... (because there is no better burger than a bison burger) and sweet potato fries. My entire group loved their meal and we ALL plan on returning soon. They also had wings, vegetarian options, salads, and side options. Highly recommend. I've come here multiple times, and the food is great. But on a day when it was 15 degrees out, my black girlfriend and I decided we wanted some warm Thai food. When we got in there were 12 empty seats. We were asked if we had reservations and we said no. We were then told the only place we could be seated was right by the door. We were ok with that, but less than five minutes later a white couple came in, said they didn't have reservations and got a seat that was not next to the door and the freezing weather. The white couple also got served before us. Unfortunately we'll be looking for a new Thai restaurant in Pittsburgh, which isn't the easiest thing in the world. First, let me say the rating is not based on the quality of food. The quality of food is actually excellent. The poor rating is based on the terrible customer service my friends and I received for the 2nd time. My friends and I went here the day after Christmas for some quality Thai food and to let another one of our friends experience Thai food for the 1st time. Upon arrival, the restaurant was filled to capacity with only outside seating available. My friends and I decided to wait since we really had our hearts set on eating here. While waiting for about 10 minutes, the host told us we should be seated shortly since another table was becoming available. A couple minutes later, I noticed the server seated a family at the table that was supposed to be for my friends and I. So I politely said, \"excuse me, the host just told us we were going to be seated at the table.\" He snarled back with irritation in his voice that the host isn't the server and doesn't know what she is doing. He moved the family together so they can be seated at 1 table versus being separated, etc. He said a little bit more but I cannot remember exactly verbatim but nonetheless his tone and body language were uncalled for. All the host could say was she is sorry and she is not the server. \n\nThis is the 2nd time I have experience rude service from the same server. The first time I complained to manager and still he walks around with the same negative attitude and horrible customer service as before. Due to this 2nd encounter, we will not be coming back to Smiling Banana Leaf. Good food but horrible service. They will not get another dime from me or my friends! 1. Make a reservation! It's tiny. Maybe seats about 30 people at a time. We went on a Thursday night and it was full. \n\n2. BYOB!!!!! \n\n3. Probably the best Tom Yum soup I've ever had!!!! So fresh and light. Got a spice level of 8 and could of gotten a 9 or 10. \n\n4. Went with the pumpkin curry. So good. Lots of chunks of pumpkin. I got a spice level 8, again could of got a 9 or 10. \n\n5. Can't wait to go back! This place is a hidden gem in highland park. I recommend making reservations especially on a busy night. It is pretty small but accepts credit cards. I love that it a BYOB and all of my friends bought a bottle with us. Unlike other Thai restaurants in Pittsburgh they don't charge you a fee to bring your bottles. That's a plus. I started off with the fresh spring rolls with tofu. Very good and light for an appetizer. If you weren't too hungry they could have been a meal. They came out pretty fast. I ordered the green curry at an 8. I actually ordered a 5 but they gave me an 8 on accident. I was fine with it and decided not to say anything. To me it was fine and it wasn't too much heat for me. It was perfect spiciness to where I could still taste the food. The prices are good and with an appetizer and an entree my meal came to under\n$20. I would come back here when I come back to Pittsburgh. The restaurant is really small but the service is great and the pad thai is excellent.  Would definitely go back if in the area. So delicious. I loved the Tom yum soup, pumpkin curry, papaya salad. You can't go wrong with any of the items here. I like things to be on the spicier side, so I got 7/10 and it was really good (made my nose run tho). They have lunch and dinner prices weekdays (dinner is $3 more), but dinner prices all day on weekends. Pricy, but authentic. This is two reviews in one: one for my dining experience, and one for a catering experience.\n\nMy dining experience:\n\nThis is a great place to bring a group because they take reservations and the food is very customizable. The decor is lovely, as well.  Thai food is a favorite with me, especially when the restaurant is friendly to vegetarians.\n\nI had the tofu paradise and the pineapple fried rice (veg). We brought our own wine, and they were very helpful about keeping it chilled. The prices are great for the amount of food that you get.\n\nMy catering experience:\n\nYes, they cater! And yes, they deliver! I was very happy about this.\n\nI ordered pad thai with tofu and the chicken panang curry. I had 60 people to feed, so I ordered a total of 60 dinner portions (30 of the tofu, 30 of the curry). This was waaaay too much food. You can get away with lunch portions and maybe even reducing the number of portions that you order.\n\nThe food was a big hit, especially since they brought a spice mix on the side so that people could customize their food. The price was the same as their in-house price, plus a discount for ordering above some amount. Overall it was around $10 per person, which is amazing for catering of such quality.\n\nThe food was on time and they helped me carry it in as well. Very great experience!", "stars": 4.2}, "Homestead": {"year": 2016, "text": "So this one time, I was driving home (South Hills) from the Waterfront, and I saw a handwritten posterboard sign that read FUDGE with an arrow pointing straight ahead.  Well, I really wanted some fudge and was intrigued by the mysterious sign. \nI pulled into the lot and thought the building was kind of shady looking, but by then, my mouth was all ready for fudge so there was no turning back (also, my husband was with me and was laughing too much at \"following the sign to fudge\" for me to turn back.) It got stranger when I walked in- it was just a small area with a glass case full of fudge surrounded by homemade crafts. The kitchen area, however, was HUGE. Still, I pressed on, hoping for the best. I figured that any place that could sustain itself like this must have REALLY good fudge, so I bought some chocolate peanut butter and chocolate cheesecake. And I was correct- it was perfect! Now i don't know about it being sharpsburg but the one in Homestead on 8th Avenue is amazing and i would be definitely going again. Love that they have Pretzel Knots not to many have them. As a sugar adict who loves sweets, I was super exited to stumble on this bakery. \nImmediately greater with a smile and assisted as I selected a few treat. Everything looks fresh and delicious! I picked up one of my fav's, apple fritters \nI'll be back again very soon Yummy donuts and baked goods. Hometown ladies running this joint. Feels like a bit of a \"taste of the past\"", "stars": 4.4}, "Homewood": {"year": 2017, "text": "Some damn good barbecue. I had a plate with ribs & chicken. Both were tender and delicious and the BBQ sauce was good. At this place you both order and pick up your food from a sort of buffet line with a server who gives you the terms you want, and then you can either eat in the restaurant or carry out. Yum!!! Love the chicken! It can be addictive....But, must watch the calories. It is definitely a treat. Order before you go as it is fairly greasy and you could leave smelling like a chicken plank.", "stars": 3.8}, "Knoxville": {"year": 2016, "text": "Best experience by this pizza shop!

Everything a coffee aficionado would need is here: good selection of origin coffees, tea, even coffee equipment. The store has a nice lounge seating area including a (real!) fire place, and a bunch of tables. Outdoor seating is available in the summer months.\n\nOnly 3 stars as my drip was lacking in flavor (three days in a row), and I had to pump it up with brown sugar (which I normally would never do). \n\nOverall though good place to hang and chill. I try to limit my negative reviews, and usually hold low standards when it comes to chain fast food joints, but this place is worthy. \nI don't expect much, it's fast food, but when your paying $6 for canned soup and undercooked bread it's especially frustrating to also deal with bad service, and that what you get here, consistently.\n\nJust go to Jimmy John or Social, jimmy John is cheaper and Social isn't that much more expensive.", "stars": 3.0}, "Lawrenceville": {"year": 2017, "text": "Smoke is a great little place that has a super friendly staff and the food is delicious! Had the chicken and waffle taco today with jalape\u00f1o syrup....oh man. Tried my friend's brisket cornbread...another oh man. The waitress was also very sweet to check on whether or not they had mimosas. Turns out they had a bottle of champagne on hand (don't know if they normally do) and got a hefty serving of one. That was a double thumbs up. \n\nThe only missing star is for the lack of menu. I wish they had more menu items! The word on the street is that they serve other things than tacos on the weekdays because they have to give their smoker a break. Aw man, you gotta be making those chicken and waffle tacos e'r-day. Would like to try a couple drinks next time! My second visit and just as impressed! The service has been awesome and they have been more than willing to accomodate me and my food allergies/restrictions even on a busy Friday night. So excited to be living right around the corner! Came here for lunch last week with a group of friends.  Started with a heaping order of avocado and peanut butter toast.  Both were excellent, especially the avocado. We also had the latkes which were good but not great.  I also ordered a 3 mezze sampler.  The hummus was fresh but the babaganoush was lacking for sure (I barely had more than a few bites).  We also had the falafel sandwich (which was pretty good but again not amazing, I don't think they make their pita fresh) and the cashew cheese sandwich.  The cashew cheese was pretty gross but that's not their fault as it's never very good (may taste ok going down but your stomach will be bloated and hurting for hours after).\n\nIf you are craving interesting vegan food in Pittsburgh, I would recommend going to Apteka and skipping this place. The dining experience and service is pathetic. After we were seated for 15 minutes nobody came to check on us. I had to stand up and go after some server and ask for menu, water, etc. Then he said \"sorry\".\n\nAfter that we tried the cashew cheese appetizer, my husband and I both liked it. For main course, I had the onion flat bread and he had the falafel sandwich. The onion flatbread was too sweet ( I am not sure if they added sugar or not). I was expecting more of a savory taste, also because on the menu it indicated that it has sumac (one of my favorite spices) which has a savory/sour taste. I did not like the onion flatbread. My husband said the falafel sandwich was not very well balanced: some parts had too little veggies to balance out the falafel. \n\nI would have liked to return to try out other items on the menu, but with their pathetic service, I doubt it. Always a fantastic meal at B52 - breakfast, lunch or dinner.  The labneh is worth a visit all on its own. Came here on a date night and was not disappointed. We split the six-plate mezze and every dish was delicious (though the fried tomatoes definitely stole the spotlight). It was the perfect amount of food for two and service was great throughout. Definitely recommend. A very cool Middle Eastern (Iraqi) place to eat if you've never tried Iraqi food before. \n\nHonestly, I've been here a few too many times. It's decent food, but nothing to write home about. I prefer some spice and flavor with my food, and even though other people really love Dijlah, I find the food to be too bland, typically. If you put salt on the rice dishes, it works wonders, but there's not much flavor in most of the lamb, goat, and beef dishes. I'm also biased towards Indian food, which usually is packed with spices (not necessarily spicy, though...just ginger, garlic, turmeric, mustard seeds, etc...). To be honest, it's not that different from a lot of American restaurants in that it's easy food for your stomach, albeit a little bit oily. \n\nIt's halal, which helps! There's a hookah bar in the back and I've seen it reserved for parties and concerts. Overall, not a bad place, but I wouldn't go here unless my friends take me here.\nStill not quite a 2, because service is fairly good, but nothing out of the ordinary. Best Middle Eastern in town by far. Excellent hummus, vine leaves, baba, and more. It's fun to smoke hookah and watch Arab Idol too. I'm really impressed with Hop Farm! My boyfriend and I decided to do an impromptu Burgh brewery crawl, (some new, some \"old\") and this one was by far my favorite! I'd never been to Hop Farm before, but I was excited to check it out. \n\nThe tap room is very cozy, with some rustic decor and a smallish bar. We ordered some beers while we decided on what snacks to get. The variety of beers to choose from was pretty good, and they had a selection from Arsenal and Apis on tap too for non-beer drinkers. I liked my beer but I didn't love it. I would have had another if we had time to stick around, but I wasn't crazy about it.\n\nWe decided on a homemade pretzel and an order of mac and cheese. I was absolutely floored with how delicious the food was! The pretzel was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside as it should be. The mac and cheese came with a homemade focaccia which was SO flavorful. I think it have as rosemary and it paired really well with the gouda in the mac. We also thoroughly enjoyed dipping the pretzel in the cheese sauce. YUM!\n\nThe menu is small, but I'm fine with that because they seem to do it all very well. I REALLY want to try the nachos next time. We saw two orders come out while we were there and they looked amazing.\n\nI'll definitely be back to try some other food and beers. I hope to see some lighter beers on the menu at some point as the weather warms up. All in all, I'm glad to have finally stopped by! Definitely a new coffee spot for this gal. Right as I walked in the two baristas greeted me with friendly smiles and warm conversation. I can tell this is heavily frequented by the locals and the baristas knew most by name. Their prices are comparable to other nice coffee places in the area (Lawrenceville, Strip District, etc.) They make a mean mocha! Will be back here for sure. Best mocha I have had! It was SO good! Just the right texture and smoothness. Not too sweet not too bitter. It was just right. We also got the blueberry orange scone and it was soo good! Had the loveliest early morning hour of work here today. I've come here a few times, generally to buckle down and do some work (free Wifi!) on a weekend day, but today I went first thing after an early morning workout. The baristas were very friendly and welcoming, and I treated myself to a gluten-free apple cider donut (yum) to go with my cold brew. This is a good place for solo work dates/catching up with friends, as opposed to having a bigger study/work group. I was sorely tempted to go back for round two after hearing someone order an orange almond milk latte, but I resisted. I may have to make these early morning EAM visits more of a habit. Stopped in around 840 on a Saturday night and was lucky to get a seat.  Had the cured trout crepes for an appetizer, they were excellent and got the burger and fries for dinner, excellent as well.  The atmosphere was great and I cannot say enough about the service.  They were friendly and genuine but not over bearing or too much in your face.   I will definitely go back. Excellent place! We had a terrific dinner and that night the restaurant was donating a share of the proceeds to charity. Eating good and doing good, an excellent combination. This establishment purports to be a \"chill\" place suitable for \"hanging.\" I ordered a Chai Latte, and whilst waiting, since the restaurant was empty, sat down at a table assuming the seating was for cafe-goers as well. Unfortunately, but one vegetarian option was on the menu which I didn't find really appealing. After notifying the waitstaff of this, I was immediately received with a hostile mood for my lack of ordering an entree. This significant affected the preparation of my drink, to the extent that i was served boiled milk, garnished with hostility. Favorite pgh restaurant. Small, inventive menu done perfectly. Wonderful fresh salads, creative pastas, delicious mains. Also, byob, which makes it the cheapest excellent meal around. I've tried calling for three days to make a reservation to use a Groupon and no answer; left a voicemail, no answer; messaged them through yelp, no answer. The person answering the phone was rude, unhelpful and arrogant.  I refused to proceed further after that experience.  Lots of great Italian places in the city...who needs an attitude.  Is it worth that plus the risk of no seating, no waiting area, no wine list.  I think not!! Loved this restaurant only downsize was busy so you have to book a reservation well in advance. Loved we could bring in our own wine. Service was good and pizzas large enough to share. The lasagna! Still thinking about this food 2 weeks later!!! Seriously delicious, excellent service, great ambience. I'm a lover of Italian food, but sometimes pasta dishes can get monotonous. Well this place has turned Italian good on its head and has some of the most creative and delectable dishes. We decided to get a couple pizzas and a few pasta dishes and do tapas style so we could all taste a variety. Get the lasagna- it was the best I've ever had and unlike any I've had. My table also loved the mint risotto special (I'm not a mint fan), and we also got the mushroom tagliatelle which was good. Honestly, anything you get here will be great but go for the lasagna as a must. Love this place! Every meal we have is delicious.... pizza, pasta and salads. The wait can be long because it's so good... we go around the corner to Grapperia and enjoy a drink while we wait. I love quality Italian food, especially homemade, flavorful pasta, and this place exceeds my expectations every time. You can always tell the quality of what you're eating when you take a bite of one of their dishes. For the fresh bread they serve upon arriving to the unique appetizers and craveable entrees, I try to come here as often as I can. BYOB is another great aspect of this restaurant. Their tiramisu is the best I've ever had in my life, definitely try it! They get quite busy on the weekends so arrive with time to wait. If there are down sides to the restaurant they are these...no reservations, and no wine menu.  The workarounds are relatively simple:  put your name on the list, then go next door to Grapperia to grab a cocktail or two while you wait, then bring a bottle next door when you return.\n\nThis worked really well for me, but did have the unforseen side effect of pigeon-holing me with a dish that would pair well with the wine I'd selected (it had a dragon on it that breathed fire, and the fire had \"burned away\" part of the label.  It was a Pinot Noir, which is a decent wine if you have to pick one, but if we're really being honest I picked it because of the label, which kicked ass.)\n\nNext time around...and there will be a next time (the food was really good) I'll peruse the menu first, then whilst awaiting my callback...I'll pick a wine that pairs with that dish.\n\nBecause of the Pinot though (and also because it sounded good) I picked the  Pappardelle con Coniglio e Funghi...Braised rabbit with pappardelle pasta, roasted tomatoes and wild mushrooms.  At $17, I thought the price point was really reasonable (I know pasta isn't generally super expensive, but I still thought it was sane).  It was earthy and had a nice balance of pepper to it.  Paired well with my flaming dragon wine (the name...I don't remember the name, but that dragon is burned indelibly into my mind like the label from the bottle).  \n\nService was casual and well-informed, prompt and courteous.  \n\nAmbience was clean and casual, well-lit, cheerfully...Tuscan?  Someone who knows stuff will have to check that.  I thought of Tuscany.  \n\nDessert was a very well executed Tiramisu.  \n\nA nice experience overall. Men who deliver my food was very rude was  mad I didn't have a large enough tip said fuck me bitch very unprofessional Our office orders takeout from here once or twice a week and every time the food has been good. It's consistent and the delivery service is fast and friendly. I came here again recently and wanted to update my review. The service wasn't that great and the food wasn't memorable. I am still reviewing them with an \"a-ok\" rating, because it just wasn't that memorable or special at all. Their margaritas are tasty, the location is good and their outdoor patio is wonderful, but I just don't love their food or their service. Maybe the third time will be a charm? First, I will be back. Second, judging from the size of the menu, I may have to visit several times.\n\nI heard good things about this place through the Yelp vine. I was happy to hear a friend picked this place for a get together. Dive isn't exactly accurate at all. The place seems to be split into a bar half and dining half, both nice places. There's no alcohol allowed in the dining area. I didn't walk around and explore so the description is more of an educated guess. Ohh, and I was kidding about the no alcohol in the dining area, that'd be ridiculous! (Hopefully you continued reading to this point).\n\nAnyways, I asked our waitress what her favorites were, per my custom. She mentioned The Professor, which sounded awesome, but I try not to duplicate orders if I can (friend's choice). I honestly had a difficult choice ahead because the menu was relatively enormous. My eyes caught prosciutto and bacon in the same row and I knew my decision had been made. I ordered The Hangover. (Really big sandwich, possibly the first I've ever cut in half before picking up). I got a side of sweet potato tots, over fries, or some other terrible choice. I have never regretted sweet potato anything. These were no different. It came with some sorta cinnamon butter, which was totally unnecessary in my opinion. The tots held their own.\n\nI'm looking forward to coming back and trying something different soon. Maybe scheduled around happy hour this time. Good food and service. It can get a little loud and crowded but it's a bar so that is to be expected. I've come here for brunch a few times and the food never disappoints. However, the service is soooo slow. It took a while to get coffee/espresso drinks, to order, then to get food, and finally to pay. I think we were there for over 2 hours, even though we had no wait to be seated and it wasn't crowded. Our waiter was working hard but he had to make all the drinks himself while waiting his tables, and I'm not sure what the other staff hanging around were supposed to be doing. \n\nI still love the food, and it was a great place for BYO before because you could leisurely sip on your mimosas while waiting for service. Hopefully they make some changes to speed up service, because it doesn't do the food justice! This Wendy's is always crazy and hectic but my food is always up quick and never have an issues. These guys are great my broke ass went in there thinking I had money and I didn't and they gave me a Baconator and fries for free thanks a lot guys! I have to admit, I was underwhelmed.\n\nThe atmosphere was cool, and the location was on point, and I'll even go as far as to say that the service was good. But the menu was so boring to me. Now, to be fair, I didn't pick this place and I was in the mood for DINNER, so maybe if I was more flexible with my meal requirements that night it would've been different. But all I know is that I wasn't impressed. \n\nThey sell \"specialty\" French dip sandwiches, which I wasn't impressed with. The concept is cool sometimes (grilled cheese all the way!), but it just didn't do it for me. The selection wasn't appetizing to me, and I was really disappointed in the lack of other options. So, if I don't want a French dip sandwich, I'm basically out of luck. \n\nI don't know, maybe I'm being a diva here, but I didn't like it. That's all. Went here on a weeknight for an impromptu post-work happy hour with some lovely friends, one of whom adores Grapperia. I had the \"Dom\" Collins, which was a cocktail with chamomile-infused grappa, lemon juice, and Prosecco, which was deliciously light and refreshing. Cocktails are very reasonably priced ($10) for the quality. My buddies sampled salamini and formaggi plates, which I'm told rotate frequently, and received high marks from all parties. I also heard a rumor of a late night happy hour which I would love to return for. Putting a pin in this one for a return review.  They were busy when I got here.  The bar is long and narrow.  A few tables line the wall, but I found all of them full.  The bar too was full.  There was a five foot section of wall that had a shelf of sorts on it.  I stood by the shelf.  It was...awkward.  A couple girls who also wanted seating also stood by the shelf.  \n\nWe pretended not to notice that we were all standing at a shelf while we sipped our cocktails.  \n\nI started with an Italian 75.  I love the French 75, so I figured...why not?  It's grappa, Prosecco, balsamic vinegar, and rosemary.  It was a good cocktail.  \n\nI started a tab and for my next round got a Nardini Reserva from the grappa menu at the bartender's suggestion.  I don't drink a ton of grappa.  It was good.  Stiff in the way that grappa can be, but good.  \n\nI ended up getting a seat at the end of the bar and found myself constantly sucking in my breath to make way for the bartenders serving the tables.  I seemed like I was...\"in the way\".  \n\nI had dinner scheduled next door at Piccolo Forno, and got a bottle of wine to take with me before paying my tab.  If you buy the bottle there, they don't charge you the corking fee at PF.  That's a nice benefit.\n\nBusy night, full house, weird seating, good drinks.  I'll try it again if only because it's an ultra convenient waiting area for Piccolo Forno, but also because I have a feeling my next experience will be better. The steak hoagies are amazing, generous portion of seasoned steak and the perfect amount of cheese. I get it well done and it's delicious. Came to Church Brew Works on a Saturday night in early May 2016 to grab food and drinks. Since this is so close to my place in Lower Lawrenceville I had high expectations, but they were easily let down. \n\nOrdered sweet potato fries and pierogi appetizer. Sweet potato fries were cold as ice , and the pierogi appetizer didn't really hit home either.\n\nPartner ordered a beer that was decent on tap , but everything else was lacking. Just seemed like some fancied up bar food , and maybe hit a miss that night with the kitchen. Haven't been back since and don't plan to be. \n\nHopefully others experience better food , that's hot and warmly served. Great place to bring out of towners for a unique experience. The beer is good, the food is slightly above average, but the main reason you come here is for the ambiance. Very beautiful building and an awesome setting for a brewery. Definitely worth stopping in once or twice a year. I love this place. It's so awesome being in there. It's just so cool. They've converted the pews into tables. There's a gigantic beer brewing thing at the front of the church (think where the altar would be.). Am I the only one that thinks it's hilarious that a church is now a bar?  I love it.  It's just such a unique place and the food is great, I've never gotten anything there I didn't really really enjoy. I've been here a lot but this one meal sticks out in my mind as the best ever. It was simple, a piece of salmon and mashed potatoes and I think spinach on the side. I also had one of the best desserts ever here, an apple strudel and vanilla ice cream. They really have a way of taking simpler menu items and jazzing them up and making them fantastic. Side note - their pizza rocks. Church Brew was excellent for grabbing a drink and watching a game in a unique environment. We were in town for a wedding and enjoyed the afternoon before the ceremony watching some college football in this beautiful church. Service was quick and attentive, and we enjoyed the pretzel with our beer. I must say -- even the bathrooms are cool. This place is worth checking out. Pretty good food, but very high prices and small portions... Two of us ate with two drinks spent $85 and left a little hungry... I did not hate my time there but I could not see myself going back Many of the dishes we had were exceptional especially a dish of mushrooms and I really enjoyed my gin and tonic (do try it). Only thing I did not enjoy was the tortilla which for no good reason was slathered in a chipotle sauce which made it inedible. The only misstep in an otherwise great meal. Cool looking spot, although difficult to find. The bar & coffee shop look very nice. My review is of the restaurant. Not kid friendly, they had no high chairs. Don't get me wrong I wouldn't take my one year old to dinner at a fine dining restaurant. But lunch at a pub or American restaurant is reasonable. Not a lot of veg on the lunch menu besides salad. The pulled pork   was dry and my bun was burnt around the edges. They offer tasteless pasta salad as a side or you can upgrade to fries for 2- I would recommend the upgrade. We went here for the weekend brunch. Avoid it at all costs. I'm not sure if it was because it was New Years Day or what but the food was really rough. There are far better places in Lawrenceville to spend $40 for brunch. The biscuits were hard as rocks and the rest of the food was very cold. Best garden salad in town. Loaded with provolone to boot. Will try the pizza next. Check out their giant iPod in the back room! Quaint, clean, modern, friendly staff, great coffee and not overly crowded (looking at you, coffee shops with 5,000 tables crammed in)!  Definitely will be back. Best coffee in the city.  A 4 shot latte is almost a dollar under what Starbucks charges, and it doesn't taste like starbucks crapola!  Great vibe, fast and friendly service. Really disappointed in the hipster pretension of this place. Reviews that say the same seem to be buried--wish I'd seen them. Twice, I have been helped by a young woman covered in tattoos with a mouth piercing, who told me I couldn't get a mocha with coffee because \"the textures don't work well together\"...second experience was no better. Won't be returning. Get over yourselves. Industry Public House isn't a restaurant that I ever have an intense craving to go to, however, they never seem to disappoint. I've tried a little bit of everything from the menu from apps to salads to entrees to burgers... all have been solid. All of their burgers and sandwiches are solid, and although I don't do it personally, they have an array of add-ons (for the fries as well).\n\nThey have a huge beer selection, some more reasonable than others, and I'm never around Lawrenceville for Happy Hour. If you're a bourbon fan, you have to try the Smoke Stack at least once, but they do have some wonderful cocktails as well.\n\nI remember when they first opened how packed it would be (which, for it's original size was impressive), but since the expansion, I'm still amazed how packed it can get. Which leads to my personal downside... the noise. The entire place is steel and sealed brick, which means it gets loud rather fast. This place has been sitting on my list since it first opened!  Finally we decide to go with some friends and I was so excited that we were able to get a reservation at the time we want. I've heard that that they are usually very busy even during weekdays. So check before you go unless you don't mind waiting. One of our friend been there before so we found the place very easy, otherwise it would take me a minute I think. The sign for the restaurant is very different and interesting just not very eye catching. The entrance is on the side-a small door. Then you will need to get on the third floor, when there are couple doors on each floor could be confusing. The atmosphere is very like an authentic/cozy Japanese restaurant that I pictured and seen in movies. They have private rooms(looks like so) for large groups where you will be seating on the floor just like Japanese. I like the open kitchen where you can see everything happening. \nEverything on the menu meant to be shared so we ordered a lot for the table to share. \nThe skewers are super good. It might sounds weird but the chicken heart was the most flavored ones out of pork belly, squalid eggs. The second everybody favorite was the fried chicken, then the squid balls, the pancake, and fried udon. Ah, another must order is their fried gyoza. Out least favorite was the miso soup which had too much seaweed taste. The only thing I could complain about is it was a little bit too salty for my taste. \n\nI would love to go back there try their ramen and everything we had again and recommend it to other friends. One of the best restaurants in Lawrenceville. I was so intimidated by the menu, but when we got there, our waitress was so unbelievably helpful. She suggested things and encouraged us to take a risk on a lot of dishes. Everything was delicious. Someone in our party was gluten free and the chef made him a special dish- so inviting I love the concept! I went with a group of friends shortly after this place opened in August. It was a rainy summer evening and the line was out the door and starting to go down the street! We decided to wait it out to give this place a try. After an hour wait, we made it inside and placed our order. The man working the cash register and taking orders this night was one of the owners. He was very pleasant and a great guy! We were even giving him some potential flavor recommendations and he was listening to all of them with an open mind! (Except for the one guy in front of us that recommended \"Creamed Corn\" flavored ice cream. The owners quickly rejected that flavor! And I am thankful they did!) We placed our order and watched them make our ice cream. It was a fun experience, seeing the whole process from starting with the liquid cream, adding all the ingredients and toppings, and finishing with the rolled ice cream. The quality of the ice cream was very good and I felt the $7 price was warranted.\n\nHowever, with the $7 price, I will only be returning for occasional visits when I am in the mood to treat myself to a sweet dessert. At 9 on a cold, rainy night, it was standing room only. It must say something about this rolled ice cream phenomenon. I could do without the people, but the whole process is fun from perusing the endless menu of options/add-ins to observing the creation to the best part...eating! For $7, choose from a list of house creations, seasonal specials, or build your own. Watch closely as the rolls take shape before your very eyes! It doesn't look like it will amount to much, but when all the rolls are transferred to da bowl, be glad that you can share 'em with someone! Went for drinks and we were very satisfied. Staff was really friendly and professional. We loved the creative cocktails and the vibe. Poor service. The waiter was poorly dressed in a dirty low cutoff sleeveless Tshirt. He was not very professional and used vulgar language at times. Food is just okay - nothing special. Have not returned since this experience. This is definitely one of my favorite pizza place in Pgh. Their crust isn't too soggy or overbaked. The toppings aren't too heavy or sparse. When I first ordered, they had both canned and fresh mushrooms and they called to ask if I had a preference which I thought was awesome. Will definitely be ordering from here again. Boy do I love their pizza!  One of my favorites in Lawrenceville!  We've ordered from them 4 to 5 times since living in the area and we've never been disappointed.  Also really good re-heated! 3.5 stars. I think the biggest benefit to The Butterwood Bake Consortium is that it's open late. Most bakeries close early and so if you're like me and get a late night sweet tooth- Butterwood is here for you. The other good things- really intricate decorations- wallpaper on the wall, lots of rich golds and maroons, and comfy seating. Almost like an old classy mansion. \n\nMy husband and I ordered a piece of chocolate cake w/blackberry mascarpone buttercream. It was very dense- definitely enough to split, and overall I wouldn't say it's the best cake I've ever had, it was okay. Also- the price was high, about $7 total. We did have to wait a bit because there was only one person working and a few people in line in front of us (about 9pm on a Friday). The girl working was very apologetic and nice. Overall, I'd recommend going to experience the ambiance and try something new. I've really want this place to succeed as its in the neighborhood. However the inconsistency with meats, usually towards the rancid end, is increasingly frustrating. Most recently, the kelbeisa that I purchased, which they have a pretty good reputation for, was of a weird  crumbly pseudo-sausage consistency and full of sodium. Once in a while, if your timing is right, you can get some good quality high-end meats. However, typically selection is very slim with questionable freshness and cleanliness. Being a transplant from Michigan to Tennessee I was feening for northern sausage and kielbasa when I visited my son in Pitt.  \n\nGreat sausage and kielbasa. Got some breakfast sausage and kielbasa to take back to Tennessee as Rebels have no clue how to do either.  Got to have Yankee fennel seed.  Super tasty the smoked kielbasa was a hit at Christmas.  \n\nGreat old school place. \n\n\nTHANX!!!!!! This does not resemble a butcher shop. Not clean, very poor lighting. You should be able to see what you are going to purchase\n. Certainly doesn't resemble the pictures on website. Terrible !!! Certainly anyone working around fresh meat that has a heavy beard should be wearing a hair net. Would not recommend. I had them butcher a deer for me at the beginning of the season. It took three weeks for them to get it finished, they also never got the antlers back to me. I called and called and called and never got any definitive information about how long it would take and my request of certain cuts were ignored. I got a bunch of ground meat and a handful of decent cuts. I am really disappointed in this business, and am honestly surprised they can even stay open with this kind of blatant disregard towards customers. And after all that frustration and dissatisfaction they wouldn't discount the already inflated price to try and make good. Some of the machines were out of order but the drinks are low price so that's a win ! Dipped in quickly on a 15 minute break for a grilled reuben sandwich.  Got my food fast and it was delicious.  Place is nice, outlets at every seat for those of us who don't like to unplug. I would go again!\n\nWould only be made better by the ability to buy liquor there! Came here for restaurant week and was not disappointed! The prefix menu had a salad to start, a choice in entree (pork and chicken or white fish), and tiramisu for dessert. I got the fish and it was so tender and flavorful. My bf got the duck and his mom got the pork/chicken and we all loved our meals. We got the mussels to start and let me tell you, some of the best mussels I've had. Simple white wine sauce. The house made focaccia is super fresh and just delectable. Will definitely be going back to try some of their pasta dishes. I honestly don't know where to begin with this restaurant. From the moment we walked in to the moment we left our experience was no less than superb. The restaurant itself is small but has a lot of character, I especially liked the taxidermied boar heads on the far wall of the restaurant. First, we ordered a bread appetizer. I kid you not, this was the best bread and butter combination I have ever had...As a starter we ordered the the large salumi plate, which in a word was EXCEPTIONAL! The plate itself looked more like art than food, and each cut of meat was seemingly better than the last. It was obviously made from the freshest possible products. Then, we got an order of oysters, I didn't have any but those whom did partake enjoyed them immensely. The next course that came out was br\u00fbl\u00e9ed halloumi with a golden beer tahini and Concord grape malawach... it was perfectly executed! Along with the halloumi came Nantucket Bay scallop crudo with a roasted watermelon conserva. I don't even like seafood but this was pretty darn tasty. Now on to the entres. For the entres we order three dishes, first, ricotta gnudi with pecorino Romano and perigord truffle, this was probably the best thing I ate at this restaurant, so tasty! Second we ordered burnt wheat tagliatelle featuring braised duck and cabbage ragout. I enjoyed the tagliatelle but to be perfectly honest it wasn't my favorite dish of the night. For our third entree we ordered the albacore tuna which I didn't try but heard good things of from those who did. For desert I had an amazing Dark Chocolate Souffl\u00e9 Cake featuring pistachio butter, concord grape must, cara cara orange, evoo and sea salt.. MARVELOUS!! All in all my experience at cure was nothing short of exceptional! Their food is really great! Full of amazing flavor and the tea and coffee is excellent too! Everything on the menu is yummy but go for a sandwich ! The women working here are the kindest ladies ever. They are literally so sweet. I'm happy they are here! Excellent location. Would recommend to any looking for a delicious rice bowl or sandwich. Keep in mind this is a Vietnamese cafe so it's not a regular restaurant but it there is MUCH to be desired. My only critique is finding a menu online is rather difficult. I hope somewhere from their shop reads this so they fix that. Facebook menu option wasn't available online when I checked. So good. So good. Can they be any nicer? I don't think that could even be possible. The workers are so friendly, sweet, and caring. I have never had a bad experience here and I doubt anyone will, EVER. The owners care about their place and they care about their customers. I basically want to be their best friends and hang out when they are not at work, they are that nice.\n\nI usually come in to get a drink and a thing of spring rolls. I love that they now make the spring rolls to order, so you don't have to get them early and quickly. They are now able to be made all day long! You can choose from tofu or shrimp. I usually go with the shrimp. I love that they are fresh and just wrapped tightly. It stinks whenever you get a fresh roll and the minute you bite in them they are not really that full and they also fall apart! These are really great. I also ask (if I am taking them to go) for some sriracha to be mixed with the hoisan sauce.  I like a little kick!\n\nThe sugarcane just is weird and I love it. Is it lemonade? Is it tart? Is it sweet? Is it delicious?! It is great. I usually have to pace myself so I don't suck up this drink so fast. Really, it is hard to not drink it fast. It is just so weird and good! I love it! I have even brought some to my friends just to see their initial reaction. I love their faces. They do not know what to think of it! I like it, and I urge everyone to at least try it...once!\n\nThe last time I came in I actually ordered a bahn mi! I ordered the classy chick and added a bit of jalapeno to it. It was a lot of spice! I loved it. The added fresh jalapenos were great! I think that if I also added in the sriracha would have been too much! But the jalapenos were great!\n\nThe bread was so fresh. Yum. The chicken done to perfection! Yum. The veggies were crunchy and fresh. Yum. I love it! I am excited to try the other flavors of the bahn mi! YUM. \n\nGo here and go wild with the menu. Try new things. Get to know the staff, aka my possible new best friends. Enjoy this new place. They are really great. \n\nMy usual lineup:\nClassy Chick: Chopped chicken with lemongrass and garlic\n\nFresh Spring Rolls: Shrimp\n\nDrink: Sugarcane juice This is officially my new spot for bubble tea in Pittsburgh (sorry Fuku Tea). The tea they use here is not only smooth and consistent (none of that foam that characterizes Pittsburgh boba tea all too well), but is also not way too sweet. The fact that the joint uses real tea leaves instead of artificial ingredients can really be told when you actually consume the drink. The boba here also is pretty solid - not too hard or too soft but just right. I also ended up trying a Banh Mi here and while it is on the mild side in terms of taste (would like some more flavor in the sandwich, maybe adding more spices or something to make it more savory would do the trick?), the bread/baguette the joint uses in its banh mi is solid and flavorful. Oh and the owners are really nice (I found out that the owners of the joint are from Philly, where the Viet food tends to be better; I'm glad they decided to come to Pittsburgh). Will consider trying some of the other items on the menu the next time I'm in. This is such a wonderful new little restaurant!  I would say I eat here at least once or twice a week. \n\nWhen you walk in, you are greeted with smiles. Even when they are super busy, you never feel like you're being hurried a long. You order at the counter and you can eat in or take it to go.   \n\nThe customer service is outstanding. I called to order food, thinking that they closed an hour later than they did, so it ended up being about 15 minutes before they closed. Rather than be rude and telling me that they closed in 15 minutes ( which most places would do), I was pleasantly surprised that I was encouraged to order Togo and that they were happy to take my order!  They called me back to clarify a missing part of my order and also put the thought into putting our sauces on the side, without us even asking. Our whole conversation, she was just so nice and even told me to tell the person picking my order up to drive safe. That to me, goes above and beyond.  \n\nThe food is consistent, simple, and fresh. They make everything to order.  It literally is the owners and their family making the food!  The bubble tea is the best that I've had in Pittsburgh. The tea is organic, the boba is the perfect consistency every time, and they even make their own aloe chunks for their drinks!  \n\nI never really traveled to this side of town, but I make the trip weekly now just to come here.  The inside is simple and trendy. Such a gem and I'm so glad that we finally have a spot like this in Pittsburgh!  I always leave with a smile, whether I eat in or take out! Love this place! Favs are tofu banh mi, shrimp spring rolls, and black milk tea with boba and lychee...but everything has been delicious. The girls behind the counter are awesome...good vibes and good food keep us coming back. The people are nice, but I like more than unflavored white rice with cold tomatoes, cold cucumbers and shredded carrots in a bowl. The little bit of tofu did not have any flavor.  I left hungry and unsatisfied after eating the very small portion of tofu and cucumbers and tomatoes.  Gave a 3 because everyone who works there are friendly and they are just starting out and because I heard good comments about the buns they use for their sandwiches. Thanks to the Yelp community I was *SO* thrilled to find a real legitimate banh mi spot! Like many of the reviewers have already mentioned, if you live or have lived here in Pittsburgh.. you know this was EXACTLY what we are missing in our city. \n\nMy mom and I came in on a Tuesday afternoon to order for a take-out not long after they opened and almost all of the seats were already taken - that's how yummy this place is! We had drunken beef and xa xiu banh mi & banh mi bo kho to go - all so delicious and perfectly seasoned to our tastes. My mom can be a picky eater when it comes to any Asian cuisine but if she says it's good, you just have to believe her. We also had ca phe sua da, which is so satisfying and goes great with banh mi. But next time I already know I gotta try their nuoc mia (sugarcane drink).\n\nOverall this place has surpassed my expectations! I'm so excited to know that the next time I crave banh mi.. there's a spot 20 mins away from me! Stupendously, supremely delicious! Had the Viet Special and the Pork N Roll sandwiches, as well as Summer Rolls, all of which memorably great. Highly flavorful combinations, super fresh ingredients, and the bread was utter bahn mi perfection...nice and crusty with a soft interior. Plus, the service was friendly and prompt. Only wish I didn't live an hour and a half away, otherwise, I'd be haunting this pace several times a week. What a wonderful addition to the Lawrenceville neighborhood. The best banh mi available in Pittsburgh? Yes. I would actually go as far to say: the best sandwich in Pittsburgh. \n\nThe store is really cute and small inside. It's family owned and operated, and I'm so excited that I finally got to try it out! The line gets long, so make sure you go with that expectation. There also isn't much seating, but you can also take the food to go. \n\nI tried the \"cha xiao\" sandwich (braised pork belly) and it was such a steal. I think it was around $7.25! They also have a large arrangement of teas. Everything is made in house, and the owners are all super willing to talk about the food.\n\nI can't wait to go back and try all the sandwiches! I went back several times now and still love it.  I got the Xa Xiu sandwich, the bo kho (beef stew) bowl, the bo kho sandwich, summer roll, and another flavor tea.\n\nThe Xa Xiu sandwich is one of my favorite.  The pork in it is great and cooked well.  The bo kho bowl  was very filling and portion great.  My favorite so far is the bo kho sandwich.  It comes with the stew and a naked sandwich.  The stew tastes great and is well done.  Paired with the sandwich, I feel like I am eating a meal my grandma made me.  Their flavored tea has been great as well.  Except the boba has been inconsistent.  First time I had it, boba was well cooked but bland.  Second and third time I had it it taste great but wasn't cooked well.  Still a work in progress.  Their summer roll is basically just their version with spring roll.  Their sauce taste great and it was also well made.  Customer service is also still exceptional.\n\nRecommendations, if you're looking to try a sandwich, The Viet Special is still the one to try.  It's the cheese steak of the Vietnamese people. Majority of Vietnamese banh mi shops will have this sandwich.  If you want something with more familiar ingredients, try the Xa Xiu.  And if you want something comforting on a cold, rainy day, the bo kho sandwich/bowl is the way to go.  Add jalapeno to everything.  It's cut very thinly so it adds a nice subtle heat to your meal but doesn't burn.  If you want legitimate Vietnamese coffee, this place got it.\n\nOverall, this place is fantastic and a must try. Loved it! Not a Banh Mi expert but everything was fresh and well flavored. The owners were exceptionally friendly and welcoming. Perfect cafe atmosphere. Don't think twice. Simple, fresh, easy food. Stupid Good. Hit the spot on a rainy winter day.\n\nBo Kho - superb especially paired with the super crisp but soft in the middle baguette\n\nCafe Phin - jolt of black coffee with chicory and the sweetness from the condensed milk This is my first time at Bahn Mi & Ti. The restaurant was busy but the friendly staff waited on me right away and my order was ready in a short period of time. A friend recommended I try the Drunken Beef and although I rarely eat beef the sandwich wasn't a disappointment.  The baguette roll is slightly crunchy on the outside and soft inside, the beef was tender and the picked vegetables, homemade mayo and sweet onions were the perfect accompaniment. If you like a spicy kick try putting some of the jalape\u00f1os. You can use Apple and Samsung pay too! I will visit the eatery again! The staff is very friendly and the service is excellent. Everything we had was delicious. We had crepes. We started with the \"Ham & Cheese\", \"Gone Fishin'\" and the \"Bonjour\". For dessert we had the \"Geppetto Signature\" and the \"Eiffel\". My favorite was the Ham and Cheese and the Geppetto. All of these crepes come as waffles option as well. Everything was so good that we couldn't leave without ordering something to go. To go, we ordered the Cheap Date, Eiffel, Nutella, the Cheesecake, the Italian, the Ham & Cheese, the Super Veg, and the Bella. I was expecting to be blown away. Completely. This was a brand new restaurant. With crepes. In Pittsburgh. The small city that has its roots in the crude steel industry; but the small city that recently began to experience a major cultural and culinary boom. I was sure Geppeto was gonna be part of that. It was even in Lawrenceville, the heart and major happening point of said boom. Alas, it was good. But it is a prime example of the disappointment (albeit a small one) of setting one's hopes too high. \n\nThe crepe was the Chicken and the Gruyere. It was a good morsel. It even satisfied my crepe longings but it didn't leave me longing for another taste. The decor is acceptable with its much-publicized books hanging from the ceiling, rugged brick and plaster walls with nooks with Pinocchio puppets, and VW bus graphics. Huh?\n\nOh well, in the end, I would still tell anyone to go here. And I bet it will improve with age. But maybe my slightly unfulfilled expectations along with Geppeto's undeniable quality is proof of just how great Pittsburgh has really become. The quality and authenticity of this bakery . . . Second to none in this city. Honestly, the value of these baked goods is incredible. I pride myself on being a connoisseur (ehmm, French) of the croissant. And this bakery's croissant . . . My goodness. It's like I've died and have gone back to . . . Cambodia (I've never been to France, but the Cambodians make some mean French pastries)? They have multiple varieties that are all delicious. Perfectly buttery. Perfectly flaky. Perfectly delicious. Oui!!! \n\nGet a croissant. \n\nAlso, buy everything else in their nice display case. Everything is so visually appealing. These baked goods are like works of art. And the tastes perfectly match the quality of the appearances.\n\nThe shop itself is also very nice. It's very quaint. Very charming. Honestly, I was half expecting Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks to show up to split a piece of quiche. You walk in and have to honestly ask yourself, \"Am . . . am I in France?\" \n\nYeah. You're not. But you might as well be. \n\nIf you enjoy quality baked goods at great prices, stop at La Gourmandine. You won't be disappointed. Everything from the employees to the shop to the goods themselves is so, oh, so inviting. Hands down one of the best parts of Pittsburgh. This is the first stop when I show anyone around the city. Brie tarts have never disappointed. \n\nAmbiance: very quaint little store front that gets crowded very quickly. If the line is out the door, they like/expect to keep the door closed and have the line continue to form outside so always dress accordingly. No indoor seating, but has a few outdoor seats if you're lucky enough to grab one during the summer. Fortunately, Lawrenceville is a great place to walk around especially on Butler Street. It's also across the street from a park with plenty of benches and swing sets. Not a place where they love to recommend things, they like to keep the line moving so decide what you want before you get up to order. One of everything is never a bad call. \n\nFood: The Brie Tart is hands down one of my favorite items in all of pittsburgh. Extremely unique with a fluffy Pasteur wrapped around slices of Brie and onion. Pain au Chocolat, Croissant aux Amandes, and all other pastries are delicious, I try something new every time depending on what I am in the mood for. Bacon Baguette is one of my favorite breads, it is exactly what it sounds like, you really cant go wrong. \n\nConvenience: Hours can be odd but always easy to swing by on the weekends.", "stars": 4.1}, "Millvale": {"year": 2017, "text": "Everyone knows Pamela's is a Pittsburgh institution, and rightfully so. Their pancakes are amazing, and \"The Big Lincoln\" might be the best bang for the buck breakfast in the state of Pennsylvania, if not beyond.\n\nI went off book though the last time I was there and got the Chorizo Hash. It was flavorful and an ample portion.  If you've never been though, you have to try the pancakes. So large yet so thin, and those crispy edges. That's what they're known for. Oh, and the Obamas ate there while in town years ago.\n\nTo be fair, I've never been to any of the other locations besides Millvale. We never wait too long there, even when there's a line and can usually find parking on the street with relative ease. Will return again and again. I'm sure the other locations are just as good though. Pamela's in Pittsburgh, every location, seems to have great food. I only give this location a 4 star review because they rarely come back after giving you the drinks- and the omelettes seem to have whole sausage patties put into them without being cut. Other than that.. every piece of food is the same, and the chaotic scene on the weekends is the same. The staff seem nice too! We were in Pittsburgh over new years and planned on indulging on all the great food PA has to offer and this place did not disappoint! Let's start with the fact that I don't order pancakes. If they come with a breakfast platter, I'll eat a few bites. \n\nWe are seated and I see all these people eating super thin, crepe like pancakes. Now I'm intrigued! So I go against my norm and order a short stack. Let's just say this place put my belief back into pancakes. They were amazing! Extremely thin cake with crunchy edges is something I've never had before and I'm sold. Great job P&G. If we make it back to Pittsburgh you'll be my first food stop. I've been wanting to try out jean-marc's bakery for quite some time now, but never manage to get to millvale.  When I find myself in millvale, I knew I had to stop in and buy some macaroons, so these are what I am basing my review on.  Let me tell you, try are delicious. I tried a variety of flavors including floral, fruit, and other.  They were all delicious. The woman who helped me was very friendly and courteous. I will definitely be making a special trip to millvale to try their other pastries. Excellent!  As far as pastries go, it doesn't get any better.  Jean-Marc is a real craftsman in his trade.  Compare these desserts to other places and you'll notice the difference in quality, truly top tier stuff.  Arrive early or be disappointed you missed out on a croissant. There are some great bakeries in Pittsburgh, but this is hands down my favorite. Came here, utilized the drive thru.. food came out fast and order was correct. The food was.. well, fast food. No complaints but also nothing to write home about. I love local breweries and this one is pretty high ranking when it comes to Pittsburgh! The space includes the bar area with several tables and bar stools, a deck area with a bench and 4 - 5 tables, and a great outdoors space that has always had a great food truck when I'm there. I have visited in both summer and winter and had a great time, but did miss the warmth of the outdoor space. On a very cold night they had a fire pit going which allowed us to sit outside for a while while waiting for our food. \n\nThings to know:\n - the whole place is dog-friendly. \n - the beer selection is wide and the samplers are a must!\n - the food truck list is usually posted, so keep an eye out and get two great PGH treats in one night.\n - the parking situation is a little tight. Just be ready to look for some street parking in the surrounding area. Too many dogs and children.  Nothing creepier than some dog owner staring at the parents with some weird envy.  I give them credit for being busy but it just takes too long to get served when you realize that they just opened.  The IPAs just don't separate themselves from anywhere else. Came here with a friend for food and bingo night. I've never played bar bingo so I had no idea what to expect. The bar was packed but there is other seating which was just far enough away to still be able to talk each other without yelling.\n\nThe food was amazing. We had wings and tater tot nachos. Both were fantastic, the wings edging just in front. Cooked perfectly and the sauce was great.\n\nBar bingo was fun although it got off to a late start because the Penguin game was on. Can't fault them for that though as it would have been impossible to hear of the game and the fans.", "stars": 4.3}, "Morningside": {"year": 2016, "text": "Great dogs and interesting topping choices. Beer battered fires, really good cheese sauce. I approve. A little costly for dogs, but i can deal for good food and good people.

The Chicago dog was just good and the chili dog was average at best. Barely any cheese in one, too much on the other,  chili was bland. Had a Hawaiian dog here today and it left a lot to be desired. It was almost $10 for a combo with fries and a small fountain drink. The hotdog itself was rather small, but tasted good.The combination of cold hoisin sauce, tiger sauce, canned pineapple, and shredded coconut did not work at all. For the same price, you can get a really good hotdog at Franktuary down the road a bit. These dogs are fantastic. Make sure you give the Carolina, Chicago, and bacon Mac n cheese dog a try. The bottled soda is a great touch. The fries and pretzels are also unique with great flavor. If you are heading to waterworks or the zoo give it a whirl you won't be dissapointed!!! Stopped by to check out Lock & Dam Dogs today.  When I first entered I noticed the joint looked clean which is always a good thing, for a place I will soon be ordering food from.  \n\nI ordered two dogs (Chicago Dog & Carolina Dog) and a medium soda.  The dogs were OK, but nothing really special.  I would have liked to see a poppy seed bun for the Chicago dog, and a little more flavor in both the slaw and chili of the Carolina.  Prices are a bit on the high side for the size of dog ($4.95 + tax each) and the medium soda (Pepsi mostly ice $1.40).\n\nAll in all, it wasn't bad, I would recommend this place if you happen to be in the area. We were so excited to see this place had reopened! We had the cheese fries , a strawberry milkshake and a hot fudge sundae.  All were very good. The staff was very attentive and friendly. Enjoyed talking to them. To the side of the building there are picnic tables that look over the river and the dam. A vista unlike any other  \n\nWhen I got home a had an email receipt from them asking for feedback. I called them to ask how they got my email and they said thru my online banking because I used my debit card to pay. Never happened anywhere before when I used my debit card. They did not  ask me if they could use my email which is the usual etiquette . Something disturbing about that. I would take a star or two away from my review because of this if I could . I love the smoothies. Very affordable prices too.  I live in the neighborhood and go there frequently. If I lived in the area, I'd SO be in trouble. Morningside has needed a place like this for a while. The prices are high, but the quality is great. I spent several mornings here while visiting a friend in the neighborhood. It was great for studying - I sat outdoors, enjoyed the shade and breezes, as well as my beloved London Fog. I tried their coffee (great), and a smoothie. All were very good, and I would absolutely order any of these or all three again. The barista was very upfront when there were a few items not available on the menu. Free WiFi, excellent coffee, a lovely location, board games nights...what else could you possibly need! Wonderful coffee shop tucked away in an unexpected place.  The coffee is excellent and the food is very good.  The atmosphere is inviting and there is some community programming, a board games night, open mic night and a lecture series.\n\nThe staff is very friendly and helpful.  There's a cool vibe here, and I enjoy going back. Great coffee and fun selection of music. A bit out of the way, though. There's open mic night events. Always on the look-out for small cafes nucked into a neighborhood and serving great food and ambiance, stopped in to check it out.  The espresso machine is good sign, so is the decor, very relaxing and homey.  It really looks nice.  OK, so why only three stars?  the food.  They have a kitchen in the back, only a few dishes are cooked on the premises.  The muffins, croissants, and other similar sweet edibles are purchased from outside and brought into the cafe.  The soups were so bland and watery that equated it to a soup from a can.  C'mon, it's harvest season:  there are plenty of farm vegetables, and it doesn't take much to make a squash soup or a minestrone from scratch.  That's what makes a small tucked-in cafe great. I tried my hardest to like Bookshelf. I am a huge fan of the ambiance and location. It's a great place to do work.\n\nHowever, the service really outweighs all of the shop's merits. \n\nI have gotten drinks here around ten times. No matter the drinks complexity--from a simple cup of tea to a cup of iced tea to a still simple latte--I have never gotten my drink in less than five minutes (generally it takes ten minutes). This includes when I am the only person in the shop besides the barista. The baristas work at a glacial pace. They frequently get distracted by their cell phones. If you have a lot of time, it is a fine place.\n\nI am lactose intolerant; therefore, I always order almond milk with my drink. Even if the server taking my order is making the order, I always ask if it's almond milk when I am handed the drink. Never has it been almond milk on the first try. I learned this the hard way after my first visit. This is a bummer on three counts. 1. I paid extra for the almond milk. 2. I pay dearly for drinking milk. 3. I have to wait another 5-10 minutes to get my correct drink. Additionally, any hot drink I've ordered has never been a temperature above lukewarm. \n\nThe baristas are very nice. However, it is obvious they have no professional barista experience and are in no hurry to serve. I've walked in and one barista is making a drink while another is on their phone and never attempted to take my order. \n\nI went in this summer when it was 90 degrees out. Inside, it was 85. The barista was very obviously not wearing deodorant of any kind. Normally, I'm all about people doing what they want. However, when someone is so pungent it fills the entire space, something has got to be changed. It's evidence of the lack of professionalism and common sense in their staff.\n\nI was a barista for four years at a small coffee shop that had a similar atmosphere and menu to Bookshelf. However, if my coworkers and I had the same work ethic as the servers and Bookshelf, we would be fired within the first week.   \n\nI keep going back because it is my local coffee shop and when they do get the drink correct it is great. However, the staff is surely lacking and needs some kind of training. Great food and atmosphere. It would be a 5 star from me if the service was a little faster. Sometimes it can take 20+ minutes for food. On a weekend that's not the end of the world but it is really the only drawback to this placd This is a nice neighborhood cafe.  Good coffee with Starbuck's prices but quite a nice atmosphere.  They have great pastries and soups.  What is engaging are the books on the wall, some boardgames and seating to get work done with a laptop.  The staff is friendly and talkative.   There are a lot of community flyers which keep the locals engaged.  This is a nice weekend spot or midday to get some writing done. They have a scrabble tournament :). Owners and staff make the place feel comfortable and homey. Super friendly staff; cosy, quirky space; not too crowded. My friend got the Amish breakfast bar and said it was delicious. I had the tomato bisque, which was suuuper tasty, and the spinach quiche, which was great and came with an enormous side salad (other side options were available - potato salad, fruit salad, chips). The cakes look amazing. Great place to sit and work on a Sunday when all the other coffeeshops are full to bursting. Love this place! Affordable, tasty, great crew working behind the counter. Be sure to check out the great views of the river from the picnic tables. Can't say enough good things about Allegheny Ice Cream Love this place and love that its so close. Owned and operated by hometown people for the locals. Owner is an amazing human being to say the least. Thanks Terry. -Cody McWilliams Absolutely disgusting tables covered in mustard, broken sprinkle machine, and 2 flavors. \n\nWe probably won't be back. Quick, super affordable tasty soft-serve. Great location right next to the zoo with surprisingly nice views of the river. I have the feeling ill be here plenty after walks in the park across the street this summer! Note* I stopped by on Memorial Day so the inside was closed, so I can't comment on the dining room. I usually come here because its on the way and I love supporting local businesses. This place has definitely come a long way since it first opened. Looks very nice and remodeled with a very friendly staff. Great soft serve also, cant wait to try the hot dogs! My only complaint time and time again is the blizzards...my favorite item; it seems as though either the machine is broken or the employees dont know that it should be mixed/blended but everytime I go its just layers of m&ms, reeses, or whatever with ice cream. I keep going back with the hopes it will be mixed but everytime no:( please please please mgmt use large m&ms and blend the blizzards!!!lol thank you;) Really great local pizza. Probably the best crust I've had in a while. Very inexpensive for Pittsburgh but you can taste quality ingredients. They don't have many specialty pizzas. So, don't call in an ask for the works. They don't have it. But if you want a delicious shredded Italian sausage pizza, or a white pizza with tomatoes, they got you. Great pizza. Dough always fresh, sauce has a nice tang, cheese blend is just right. Delivery has been prompt each time. Definitely our fav neighborhood pizza delivery place. Great tasting pizza for an unbeatable price ($10 large). The subs are better than the pizza even. If you're in the area or live nearby this is your best option. Any time I call it's always 19-20 minutes and it's ready in exactly that time frame.\n\nEdit: THE HOAGIES ARE SO GOOD This is a small takeout and delivery pizza shop in Morningside.  It has good pizza and salads and I presume the hoagies are also good but I have not tried them.  They doe a very good business and customers appear satisfied with a lot of repeat business.  It appears to be a local favorite.  I had avery good slice of pizza, good cheese, nice sauce and well prepared.  You can get served as a walk-in in 10 minutes or less.  Not the best pizza in Pittsburgh but adequate.  The owners, cooks and staff are all friendly and engaging.  Definitely has a neighborhood feel. I'll definitely be back when I am close by.", "stars": 4.0}, "Mt. Oliver": {"year": 2017, "text": "Love the chicken and the fried okra. They are on. It's grub hub and order up which is awesome!", "stars": 4.0}, "Mt. Washington": {"year": 2017, "text": "The LeMont, at one time, may have been the fanciest restaurant in Pittsburgh. However today, it comes nowhere close. The one positive thing I can say about LeMont, is the view of the city is great. The food here is ok at best, but nothing that you'd associate a fine dining restaurant with. Their cocktail and wine list are poor. The decor is gaudy, and far out of date. There are numerous other restaurants in Pittsburgh that top the LeMont, including ones with a great view of the city. Our family visited Le Mont restaurant during the January 2017 Pittsburgh restaurant week. It's the best restaurant in Mount Washington we have ever visited. The food is the best. The service is great! We had the opportunity to dine at Le Mont for my belated birthday dinner. My birthday is always during winter restaurant week. This was my first restaurant week experience because for whatever reason, we never took advantage of it.\n\nI made reservations via open table about a week in advance. My actual birthday (Friday) didn't have too many reservations left (only 9pm) so we decided on Sunday dinner here. \n\nI am going to agree with other reviewers and say that you pay for the view. Food and service are okay, but for the hype and (regular) price of entrees, I just expected things to be better. \n\nI ordered off of the restaurant week menu. Honestly, Le Mont had a good pre fixe compared to other places. I went with the stuffed sole. It was stuffed with crab and almonds.  I got to choose soup or salad (salad) and a dessert (strawberry shortcake). The server assistant brought out bread for us. While appreciated, the bread was oddly very salty.. like pretzel salt. Thankfully the poppy seed bread made up for it. My salad was initially served with the wrong dressing and I had to send it back. \n\nMy boyfriend didn't care for the pre fixe menu ordered from regular dinner menu. He went with the duck. It is marinated In raspberry vinaigrette and cooked. afterwards more vinaigrette is placed on it. The dish was absolutely amazing and I highly recommend it. It put my stuffed sole to shame, lol. \n\nThe sides for our dishes were mashed potatoes and veggies (carrots, asparagus). The mashed potatoes were extremely dry, unseasoned and very bland (think instant mashed potato flakes and water!) It was disappointing. At first I thought they were just slacking since I was using a pre fixe menu, but my boyfriend $45 entr\u00e9e was served with the same basic potatoes.\n\nMy strawberry shortcake was delicious. We also bought a bottle of wine. \n\nWhile the view and duck entr\u00e9e were amazing, everything else was pretty basic, including service. Don't get me wrong, she did an good job, but I guess I was just expecting to be \"wow'd\" more since its a fancier place. The hostess basically ran to seat us at our table instead of kindly asking us how we are doing or making sure we were even caught up with her. (ive been a hostess at chain restaurant and fancy wine bars so I know how to professionally greet & seat guests.. I just expected more courtesy I suppose)\n\noverall the experience was fun, but for the price there are better places out there, especially on Grandview. I am glad that we went here for restaurant week because I would be very upset if we spent the money they ask for on the regular menu for such mediocre food. I understand that you pay for the view/service/ambiance but I feel like they served us a freezer meal. The service was great but we will not be back. Pittsburgh has so many amazing options for much cheaper prices! This is the second time we've had Marnie, and she's always made us feel a bit awkward. I asked for penne ala vodka, which I know is no longer on the menu but they can still make. They brought me out an entree that looked almost like a carbonara, and I began to ask about if this was the correct meal. I have had penne ala vodka multiple times here with a pinkish sauce accompanied by penne pasta. She said again it was \"vodka pasta\", and did not\ncare to ask about my concerns when I sent it back with another server. She stated loudly \"there is chicken in it,\" because I did add chicken to my penne ala vodka. I am one to not argue, so I continued to try to like my meal, but I did not. I hope to go back to la tavola again based on my\nprior experiences. In addition to taking into account a better customer experience, unlike Marnie showed tonight, I would expect a better product and accommodation.\n\nThank you. We were seated in the basement \"lounge\" which has a drastically different vibe in comparison to the upstairs which is loud and crowded. The best thing about this restaurant was that it was BYOB, the servings were large, and the eggplant appetizer was really tasty. The restaurant would otherwise receive 4 stars but most of my party's entrees were SPICY. The stuffed peppers felt like biting into a jalepe\u00f1o! Mine had a Bolognese sauce which also had a kick that I couldn't  even get through half. The only dish that wasn't spice was the seafood pasta dish but it only had 3 mussels in it, a real let down. I have been here a few times for drinks.   \n\nI always have fun.   The bartenders are engaging when they are not slammed.    Here is my summary:\n\n1. The drinks are good (great pours).  \n2. The place is clean (in my opinion)\n3.  Great service\n4.  Food looks good\n5.  There is a good number of regulars (old and young).   This usually validates that it is a good bar.  \n\nThe only downside is parking.   It is Mt. Washington. My husband and I have been to this place a few times. We have sat at both a table and the bar and our waitress and bartenders were very smiley and friendly. The food was great and came out perfect considering how picky I can be sometimes. And in general the atmosphere was good, and I say \"in general\" because the one glaring flaw of this establishment was the surly manager (Michelle, I was informed was her name) who was screaming at the other employees in full view of the customers, disturbing the otherwise peaceful and enjoyable atmosphere. This woman was just terrible. She was running manically around the bar and restaurant area as if the sky were falling, while to my admittedly untrained eye, it didn't seem to be that busy. I would consider going back to this place, but I would suggest ownership of this place to consider cutting ties with someone who acts so unprofessional and detracts from the overall experience. Went for the wings as I've heard how great they are.\n\nFirst, the good:  wings were cooked to my liking, menu was interesting, drinks were good, and the place has a cool vibe with a giant bar area and nice tables.  The coyote flavor wings are fantastic.  5 star on that flavor of dry rub.\n\nThe bad:  my girlfriend had breakfast tacos and she said the eggs were like instant scrambled eggs and that the tacos weren't hot.  We also ordered pulled bacon and it was a big let down being slightly cold and not as good as regular crispy bacon.\n\nAll that being said I'd certainly go again to try more wings.  Also, we parked up the block and walked 200 yards down and had no issue with street parking. I have been to Bingham Tavern twice now, and both times had great food, drink, and merriment! The first time I visited BT was before the Guns n Roses concert, which I believe was a Tuesday afternoon. The place was not full by any means, but for a Tuesday at 3:00, definitely a decent bar crowd. My sister and I ordered the loaded fries and added pulled pork. A carnivorous, glutton's dream! We also ordered the Pittsburgh Steak salad, which was also super yummy. This trip however, as a pre game for the concert, was more of a drinking engagement, and our stayed drinks were filled by the friendly bar tender. \n\nMy second visit to BT was about a week ago, just prior to New Years. Just like myself, a lot of people must've had the week off because we were lucky to find a seat at 1:00 pm. Sarah was behind the bar, what a rockstar. Even with literally every seat taken up, she took her time with us and answered our questions about certain menu items. Obviously we could see it was busy, and she did give us the heads' up that the kitchen was crushed and the food might take awhile. ( I very much appreciate this prior to ordering so you can decide if you want to be patient or jet.) We ordered the pulled pork poppers, finally tried the wings, and an order of buffalo mac. Sarah kept us hydrated while we waited for our order, and the mood of the bar was festive and cheerful. Although the food took a little time to come out, everything was hot and fresh when it arrived and delicious! \n\nThe only negative I can say about BT is that the menu has so many delicious options, it is very hard to choose what to get. Next time I am in the burgh, I will be sure to stop back! Love Satalios, the perfect neighborhood local. If you're looking for something fancy, go elsewhere. They'd probably appreciate your business regardless, but no one else will. I can't even believe they call this food. The cook is clearly lazy. The bacon cheeseburger tasted like it had been left out for 6 hours before it was served. The menu has a lot of useless blabber on it -- just get to the point. I shouldn't have to read a novel to understand what I'm eating. I used to go to this place years ago and remembered the food being pretty good, but when I took my guy here tonight I was embarrassed by my suggestion. Never again! Never had a bad meal. Chicken with string beans is our favorite! Eggplant is also very good. Quick delivery.", "stars": 3.6}, "North Side": {"year": 2017, "text": "I'm not sure if this is the Location that we visited but regardless, this place was awesome! I've never been to Pittsburgh before. My co-worker took me here for lunch as he said this place has amazing burgers and milkshakes. We came in on a Tuesday around noon. We were greeted and seated immediately. Our server, Deisel, was super nice and very attentive. The menu is awesome. They have a full page of different milk shakes, salads, and burgers. They give you the option to build\nYour own burger and choose meat, bun, toppings,rubs, and sauces. They have vegetarian options as well. My burger was amazing, perfectly cooked, and the chips were great too. The prices weren't bad and totally worth he finished product and experience. The atmosphere was cool and casual. I will definitely return if I'm in Pittsburgh again. Good burger and delicious beer. \nInteresting options and choices. \nNot spectacular. But satisfying. Staying at nearby hotel, walked over based on Yelp reviews. Had an onion ring app, didn't care for it, was VERY greasy. Sauces were good. Ordered steakhouse burger, which was solid but unremarkable - I've gotten onion straws on plenty of burgers before. Sauce was unremarkable, chips were fresh but unseasoned. It was okay...but 25 bucks is a lot to pay for an okay burger, onion rings and a diet coke. Could have done as well at a number of places for half the price. Wait staff was excellent. I loved the pretzel milkshake but the burger made me sick to my stomach I had to leave after a couple bites smh Our Meetup group stopped for a late lunch after visiting the Omnimax at the Carnegie Science Center.  It wasn't a busy time so we were seated quickly and the server was very accommodating since there was 9 of us and of course separate checks yada, yada, yada. She kept checking on us to make sure that everything was ok and was always pleasant.  \n\nEveryone ordered different selections and they were all very pleased that we came there and raving about their choices, pizzas, salads, sandwiches.  I am on a quest for the best fish in the burgh and that was my choice.  It was good, needed to cooked a little longer since it was still a little grey but still good. It was a thick cut of Cod not skinny, good batter not cornmeal. The fries were right up there as well, fresh cut! Yes. They have a nice variety on their menu, something for everyone. \n\nFor myself being the organizer of the group I was happy that they were pleased with my choice for dining and felt it was a great get together going a place they would of never been other wise. So I know they will all be back when they are in the area.\n\nOh yea, Great view of the city! I'd like to call this place a Hidden Gem, but it seems like the word is already out. Parking is a bit of a challenge, but once you touch down, you are always greeted at the counter by name. My go-to sandwich of late has been the hot pastrami sandwich. It is served hot, on a marble rye bread, loaded with lean cuts of pastrami, cole slaw, and a \"deli sauce\" that really ties everything together. Seating is limited inside the venue, and parking can be tricky, but the price combined with the quality of food your getting makes everything worth it. Its been my spot for a few months now, and i don't foresee that changing. Awesome ! went on a monday afternoon, it was quiet but that's okay. had the street tacos app, perfect amount for dinner and delicious! our waitress dayna was the best, so nice and super helpful. She helped us find out where we should go for the rest of our day in pittsburgh. always a good place to go. Unlike many of the reviewers, I enjoyed my stint here.  I've been to several casinos in different states (ok, not Vegas so we'll not be comparing it to the mecca of betting venues) and I have to say this one did not disappoint me.  \n\nThis was my husband's and my second time here, but the first was just to walk through it.  This time was our first venture to stay awhile and bet to pass away some time before an event close by.\n\nWe first parked in the attached garage (for free, by the way) and took the elevator to the casino.  We headed to the cashier first off to get the lay of the land. Did they have a player's card for use in the slot machines and at the betting tables?  Yes, but you don't need one.  Ok, we opted to just use cash as we are not frequent visitors.  We learned that the floor is divided in half by smoking and non-smoking sections clearly marked and that they are a duplicate of one another in the games they have.  Great!  I was worried I'd have to sit next to smokers as I am not one.  We learned that soft drinks are complimentary.  Yay for me!  Also, there's a complementary coat check (with a tip jar) so we took advantage of that and left a tip at the end of our journey.\n\nWe next headed to an ATM inside the casino (ok, here I admit we should have taken care of money before coming here as there is a 5.00 charge per ATM transaction.  Ouch.).\n\nThere are lots and lots of slot machines, craps tables, baccarat, and black jack tables.  My husband opted for slot machines while I opted for the black jack table.  It was around 3:30pm so there were a couple $5.00 minimum tables, though I did have to wait about 15 minutes for a seat to open up.  My experience was good; the dealers were cordial as were my table mates.  I settled in trying to remember the details of playing.  Fortunately, it all came back pretty easily and I was able to hold my own for the time I wanted to play.  At 5:10pm (weird time), the table minimum went up to $10.00.  We had plenty notice as they put out a sign to let us know.  \n\nAfter playing, we cashed in our chips and headed to the buffet.\n\nI had a good time, didn't lose but a little bit in the process, and ate a decent meal afterwards.  I think that counts as a good outing. I've gone to this casino 3 times and do enjoy it. Their buffet is good (I've only ever gone there for lunch), I like the variety of slots they have and they allow you to video record your slot play. They also have self-serve beverage stations - somehow here in Ohio they felt those aren't necessary and it takes forever to even see a waitress. \n\nI've gotten some nice free play and food offers from Rivers so I will continue to go there. Horrible food at this place. Cold fries and dry burger. Warning..when ordering at drive thru- check your order before leaving. Apparently they have no clue what no ketchup and no mustard means. A bunch of people there who don't give a crap about service. Will never go back. Great spot to go after the Steelers game. Looks like there's a nice outdoor area for sitting by the river. Nice beer selection and yummy food. It was a bit pricey though. Food was absolutely amazing, we started with the Stone Crab Claws it was paired with a ravigote sauce don't know exactly what was in it but man was it good, lemon and a bed of greens, i then had the pumpernickel pheasant breast that looked fried over a pile of German potato salad and the creamiest cucumber salad, the hot and cold mixture of the two worked well together but the texture of the pheasant is what won me over. my wife had the sauteed skate wing at first i didn't know what to expect but when it came out the modern/rustic plating was a sure surprise. The roasted carrots and green cauliflower went well with the pairing of the sweet raisin sauce that was splattered almost artistically.\n\nService was alright, although i would prefer to have my first glass of water poured by server while greeting the table, draft beers have a great selection. Didn't try cocktails although will definitely be returning to try them. From the view i had at my table looks to me like it would be a HOT SPOT during the warm summer nights. \n\nAll in all this has been a great experience with a tremendous addition to the North Shore. My wife and I say that we cannot wait to return to try even more on their menu. Went here for New Years Eve at 6. Overall the experience was just ok. The food is too expensive for the quality. Our server was nice but never came around and we had dirty plates on our table the entire 2 hour experience. Never offered refills. Some of the food was warm at best. Do not order the bone marrow. It is tiny. The cheese board has some decent items but not worth 15 dollars. Our dessert was 9 dollars and not worth it. Overall the food was decent but our experience was worse. Food, service, and prices are all good here. Both times I've been in, however, the front is empty--it's just a tough layout and no one knows what they're getting into until a hostess leads them to the back. Solution:  please convert this space to a coffee shop format similar to Starbucks with breakfast and lunch sandwiches made fast.  I work nearby on north shore drive, along with hundreds, if not a thousand other people who have no options for coffee and quick bites. All of the venues here, save for maybe burgatory, are geared toward the event crowd.  SAP just announced 242 new jobs coming to North Shore drive. Beat Starbucks to the punch and help us find a reasonably priced meal that doesn't require sit down service, crossing a river, or a delivery from jimmy johns.  Thank you. Recently tried this place for dinner....all-in-all it was pretty good. They had a great beer list and the kale Caesar salad was very good. My husband got the cod which was tasty but not filling. The only real side to it was bok choy and he only got two small bulbs. The other side it was paired with was segmented, marinated grapefruit. Should have been a garnish but there was enough of it and nothing else that it was a side. I mean this isn't an a la carte establishment. The dish would have had more value for the price if it was paired with something...anything else! Rice, perhaps? I let my husband share my salad and fries as that dish was just not enough for a fairly hungry adult male. I'd like to say I'd be back but now just not sure if we can trust the other entrees...in that they will be just as small with odd pairings. We'll see how the restaurant progresses...as North Side dwellers we are in dire need of a decent yet affordable restaurant in this area. My wife and I stopped in here before a killer show at Stage AE last night. We chose this place because we weren't really interested in any of the others that are in that immediate area.\n\nAtmosphere: It was about 6:00 and we were worried there might be a wait, but to our surprise the place looked empty when we walked in. Not a single person in the small dining and bar area, aside from the hostess. It was a little off putting at first, I'm not going to lie. While I don't like to wait long for a table, I also don't want to eat at a ghost town. We got seated right away, though, and the hostess led us back a hallway to the main seating area. There were a handful of other parties in the back, which was nice to see. The aesthetic of the place is rustic/industrial, which I like, even if it is over done at this point. They did some cool stuff I haven't seen before with it too, so I enjoyed peeping at those details. Pretty good tunes playing over the speakers as well. Could have done without the TV's on the wall next to my table, but I get it. Being so close to the stadiums, I'm sure they get a decent crowd of fans in there on game days. They have a really nice outdoor patio that overlooks the river, but it was cold and rainy when we were there, so maybe next time.\n\nFood: The menu is on the smaller side, but I'm okay with that because they had several options I would have eaten, and I've  The read in other reviews that they change their offerings somewhat frequently. I ended up getting the Pickle-brined Fried Chicken Sandwich with fries and their homemade ranch (I'm assuming it was homemade because it wasn't typical and was very tasty). The sandwich was a good size, and if I wasn't going to the show directly, I probably would have only eaten half at the time, but I gorged myself instead. The chicken thick and super crispy which I dug. I was expecting more of a pickle taste, but it really wasn't there. Though, I suppose I'd rather it be too little than too much when it comes to pickle chicken. The sandwich had actual pickle chips on it and I think that's really where all the pickle flavor came from, not the \"pickle-brined chicken\". The fries we also good. Just a little too salty for me, but dipping them in that wonderful ranch helped with that. My wife got the Grilled Cheese with Bacon. I had a bite and the cheeses they used had great flavor together. \n\nDrinks: Pretty good draft list. And they broke it all down by style, which is always super helpful to me. I got the Destihl Gose because why wouldn't I pair a sour beer with pickle chicken. Hind sight, it may have been a bit much, but since the pickle chicken wasn't all that pickly, it all worked out. They also had a large bottle selection, wine, and cocktails. \n\nOverall, we had a good experience, and I'd probably go back again. Pricing was reasonable (totaled $31.xx plus tip) and the food was good. Hoping to check out that patio on a nice summer's eve. I came into Pittsburgh for the night for the annual Ohio University Christmas Party last November, and it was being hosted here. When I first got there, I thought that there was only one room in the front, but boy was I wrong - the place is freaking huge and super nice/new. We were situated in the back room with a long table right by the bar (perfect for OU Bobcats). The wait staff was super attentive and nice, considering there were about 30 of us who steadily got more and more drunk as the night progressed. They kept a constant variety of appetizers out for us to munch on, including a great meat/cheese tray and some delicious pumpkin pierogies. Thanks for the great service and the great night! Excellent all around! Great place to see live music and enjoy delicious food ! 15 different craft beers on draft at all times. Three floors to choose from, with each floor featuring live music almost every night. (Closed Mondays) I really, really like this place! The food is consistently good, in some cases fantastic (for the type of food it is, which is an important qualifier). The drink menu is ever changing, but is always great. I live in the neighborhood and if I have visitors who want to grab a bite locally this is always my first choice. Also, the service here is always very nice, albeit sometimes slow, but nothing that would make me not choose to come back. Great place, well worth checking out; excellent feature for the neighborhood!\nAlso, the lower ratings on here baffle me. I've brought tons of people here, and I've never heard anything less than glowing. So just FYI, if someone has given this place a poor review, look to see what else they've reviewed... those who frequently review chain restaurants and rate them kindly might not be the people you want to be taking advice from. Or maybe you do? Either way just wanted to give a little perspective. I'm giving Subba 5 stars and ignoring appearances. This is not a spot for a date, but the food is simply amazing. If you don't mind eating situations or are doing take out, this is a must try. This is a fantastic Nepalese/Indian restaurant and this is coming from people who have lived in India and eaten Indian in the UK and throughout the US. Everything was good, but you must get the Chicken Momo and the Masala Tea/Chai. The dumplings are some of the best we've had (and we lived and traveled in China too), and the chai is the wonderfully creamy, sweet chai that you can get at any roadside stand in India and only very rarely in the US. Our entrees were excellent as well - the Chicken Datsi was creamy and delicious and the Nepali Chicken was an excellent sampler of various salads and dishes. Go and enjoy! Hands down the best Lo Mein noodles ever! I think sometimes Lo Mein can feel weighted down and soggy, but these noodles were fresh and delicious! Highly highly recommend giving them a try. First time enjoying this type of food, but definitely worth the trip to the North Side on a snowy night! I was not entirely prepared for the spice level, but the flavor was wonderful and the portions were great. I got the Fish Nepali dish and my boyfriend got the Chicken Biriyani. Both   delicious, even if we had to mix in a bit more rice to offset the heat haha! The building seems a bit older, so the lighting was kind of dim and made things harder to see, but the great food outweighed any quips about the atmosphere. Very nice service as well! Can't wait to go back! I was so incredibly impressed with this place! I can't wait to go back and try more.\n\nIt's a little nondescript on the outside and I might have had trouble finding it if I wasn't with a friend who had been there before. It's not the fanciest place in the world and it's on the second level of the building, so you have to walk up a large flight of stairs that does NOT feel like its leading to a restaurant. The layout and decor might be difficult or intimidating for some people, but I promise it's worth it! Get up those stairs.\n\nThe menu seemed to be a mix of American-Chinese, Nepalese and Indian food. We started with the chicken momos, which were dumplings served with a very spicy dipping sauce. My friend and I both ordered the Shrimp Lo Mein while our other friend ordered a spicy curry pork dish. I can say hands down it was the best Lo Mein I've ever had in my life. The portions are huge and I'm embarrassed to admit that I still ate the whole thing. I couldn't help myself. Everyone loved their meals and we all cleaned our (very large) plates.\n\nWe chatted with the owner, asking for menu recommendations and he was very friendly! I'll definitely be going back here soon! If you're looking for gentrified neighborhood with all people of one race and one social income and tons of hipsters this is not the place for you northside is a diverse community and this establishment shows that This has to be the worst crazy mocha everything tastes bland, burnt or cheap. The location is great. The store is cute for its size but most of it is crappy mixes the drop in a blender. This is not coffee it's an imposter Wonderful spot to regroup/relax/sip/nosh/compute/web surf.  \n\nWe had just parked on a side street and were headed to the grand opening of Alphabet City bookstore (part of City of Asylum) this dreary Saturday afternoon.  We thought we'd stop here to get our bearings and warm up with something hot -- coffee for my husband and chai latte for me.  Yum....\n\nIt's an inviting space with an exposed brick wall inside and tables and chairs set about.  This day there were plenty of open tables with several patrons chatting and/or working on their computers.  Free wifi is advertised here.\n\nStaff is helpful and friendly.  \n\nNote that you need to get a restroom key from the staff (and the restroom was clean).  (I also picked up a City Paper here.) I really, really like it here. Nice change from Starbucks every few days. In the summer, I come here exclusively for their drink 'white cocamocha.'  It's a frozen drink.  OMG so good. I can't wait until Spring when they start making this again. If you want a treat, get a piece of the red velvet cake.  I get one almost every time I go in there.  They also have really good muffins. They're big and really moist. And there have always been super friendly people working every time I've been in there. One of my favorite places to hunker down to study or work. I always order their chai tea latte (the best I've ever had). Staff are super friendly. It does get busy, but there is always a lull in activity around 3 and afterwards on any given day. Only down side is that if you want to park close, it's 2 hour paid parking. Upside- you can park for free further away and get your exercise in too. I've been to other locations before and this one in the North Shore did not change my opinion of the local Steel Cactus chain. Steel Cactus, to me, is just average all around. I came to this location for a work holiday lunch and to my surprise, we were the only ones in the entire restaurant. The dining space was also surprisingly small, which I think other locations might be larger. \n\nOur table ordered a selection of chips and dip and the red salsa was my favorite. I thought the guacamole was bland and the queso was ok, however resembled more of a beer cheese than a queso. I ordered the shrimp tacos and thought they were pretty tasty. The sides, though, were an embarrassment. My sides of rice and beans came in little cups that you typically get condiments in, which might not even be so bad if the platter everything came on weren't so large, highlighting exactly how small everything was. For $13, I expected a bit more. \n\nSteel Cactus is not my first pick if I'm in the mood for Mexican, unfortunately. Will I return? Maybe, but probably not anytime soon. We came here prior to a Pirates game on a Saturday afternoon during the 2016 season and the restaurant got crowded pretty fast. We were here from 1-2pm and there was a high traffic of people throughout that hour waiting for the gates to open. The great thing though is that not only do they have seating inside of the restaurant, but they also have seating outside.\n\nOur stop here was brief, but we ordered 2 appetizers while we were here - The Traditional Guacamole and Nachos with Beef. Unfortunately, both appetizers were very disappointing. First, the Guac. The Guac appetizer came with a lot of tortilla chips, but the amount of Guac for it was very small. We were quite surprised at how little Guac was in the bowl, if you can call it that. In addition, the Guac lacked flavor and we had to salt it on our own to give it a little kick. The Nachos with Beef wasn't that much better. Once again, there were plenty of chips on the plate, but the lack of beef was disappointing. Some of the beef and ingredients were on the bottom, but the spread of the ingredients on the tortillas was still not as much as we would have liked. If anything, we enjoyed eating the chips with the Chohula Hot Sauce on the table more than we did with the Guac or Beef!\n\nThe critiques don't stop with the food though. The service wasn't horrible, but it wasn't great either. The waitress we had seemed semi-friendly, but we felt she checked up on us way too much constantly asking if we needed something else. In our 1 hour there, she probably came back to ask the same question about 5 times. We ordered 2 appetizers because we felt 1 would not have been enough monetarily with the both of us at a table, but the waitress was a bit too aggressive coming back to our table over and over again. Sometimes waiters/waitresses don't give another attention, this was an example of TOO MUCH. Just when we thought she came by too often, when it came time to pay, she was no where to be found. I gave her my credit card, but she ended up going to other tables to take down orders and didn't return until 10-15 minutes later.\n\nI hate saying these things about establishments, but the truth is the truth. Not only were we served below average appetizers, but the service was right there with the food. The good thing is that this restaurant has major potential and it's not out of their realm to fix these problems because they are definitely resolvable. Two visits on 12/23 and 12/29.  I wanted to like this place, I really did.  Simply put, the beer is just not good.  I do have experience in brewing, so I do have some sense of proper flavor profiles and the process.\n\n12/23:  The first thing that struck me was that out of the gate, they've gone for barrel-aged porters and stouts.  Found this unusual as most new breweries perfect their base stout and porter before adding the complexity of barrel-aging.  The Blonde was just undrinkable.  It had a very off taste that reminded me of sanitizer.  While I have had some bad beer in my life, I just could not finish this.\n\n12/29:  came back with a group (after my first experience was not enthused but wanted to give it another try).  This was a mix of serious beer geeks, beer enthusiasts and people that just want to have a beer.  To the person, there was unfortunately unanimous agreement that the IPA and Blonde were awful.  The folks with limited beer knowledge described them as 'tasting like soap'.\n\nAfter my first visit, I thought maybe someone got overly aggressive with their pint glass cleaning and didn't rinse them, or there was an issue with the tap lines.  Seeing the same issues and in multiple styles, a week later, the batches are simply just bad.  Best guess is there was some improper sanitization of vessels during the brewing process.\n\nI've seen serious brewers with years of experience at some of the larger craft breweries at my home in CA, in their solo brewery startups, dump a batch for much less.\n\nShort-term suggestion: dump the current Blonde and IPA, stop selling them to the public.  It's already ruining your reputation.\nLong-term: bring in a brewer with significant experience at an established brewery (or hire one to consult) to help you fix your recipes and tighten the process.\n\nThis is one of the downsides of the craft beer boom;  eventually, everyone that has done a few homebrew batches thinks they can start a brewery and you end up with lower quality market entrants.  Sorry to be harsh, but I dislike seeing this as it sullies the impression of the new/lesser-educated beer drinker as to how things should taste and turns them off from trying those that are doing it right. Went with a few friends on the opening week of the bar. For beer drinkers, they loved the options. At that time (not sure what the status is now, I'll have to go back) they did not serve anything other than beer (nothing gluten free). However, I chatted with the owner for quite some time and he asked for suggestions. He was very friendly, as was everyone else at the bar. The atmosphere is great, very intimate. I loved the feel of it. This is a great place to grab a beer with friends and catch up. I've forgiven their rudeness over the phone many times, basically because I am able to order online. Tonight my son forgot to order one of our pizzas online and they gave him SO much grief about adding to the order that I finally took the phone. Asked the guy if we could add to the order, or at least have 2 online orders delivered at the same time. I get on the phone and this jack wagon says \"It's not MAGIC, ma'am!\" Ummm not asking for magic. He hung up on me. Solid business skills. Cancelled my order and got Dominos. Learn some people skills, you idiots I have ordered from here before for delivery without an issue. Last night I ordered for my family on yelp and waited over and hour with no sign of the delivery . The estimate said it was about an hour so I waited to call the restaurant. When I did call the guy you answered made me repeat the address and my order over 5 times before telling me he never got our order! I had a conformation number and email . I'll never be ordering from here again. Terrible experience. Awesome bartender- ask for Michelle... Good Happy Hour specials- half price drafts and Apps from 5-7... Delicious looking food coming out of the kitchen...  Come here and enjoy the quiet, cool, relaxing ambiance... (Before the Pirates come back to town!)... This place is under new management and I met her. The new owner/manager is so friendly and really excited to bring Hungarian food to The North Shore. I love the food, and it's such a fun place to hang out. I had previously been writing a detailed review of this restaurant but have decided that this place will crumble on its own without any help from me.\n\n Here are the finer points tho. \n\nFood is good,  but not great. \nServer was completely untrained with no knowledge of the menu. \nIt took 45 minutes from the time the first entree hit the table to the last,  with many mistakes and errors in between.  Our checks took equally long to fix.  Despite our continued patience we were not offered anything by the owner,  who after a while,  quit apologizing out of embarrassment.\n\nAlso would like to point out that this new business has been open for some time now with only 2 reviews.  Normally,  I'd expect more especially when I had heard such positive things... Walked in and it smelled so good!!!!! Kelly could tell that we were new and recommended appropriate dishes for our tastes,  mild or spicy,  as well as sides that went best with it. He was really nice and the food was So friggen good. Seriously, the goat curry and cabbage, and then the jerk chicken and collard greens. All so flavorful and so delicious! Honestly thinking about it again now is making my mouth water. Highly recommend it. This place is awesome. My girlfriend and I walked in from the cold Pittsburgh streets and for an hour we were transported to the islands. The food was fantastic, jerk chicken and curry goat in generous portions, but what made the experience special was the warm hospitality of the owner. He knew we were first timers and walked us through the menu, offering helpful suggestions throughout. The whole atmosphere was very Caribbean, with brightly painted walls, a steel drum in the corner, upbeat island music giving the dining experience an energetic feel. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone. Be careful though, the jerk chicken is not for the faint of heart! Good Jamaican food and Jamaican soft drinks. The Jerk Chicken was phenomenal. Only a takeaway restaurant so have somewhere close to go so you can enjoy your feast. Great coffee and Service, what more can you ask for! They make coffee the right way! prices are similar to any specialty coffee shop nothing crazy Really cute coffee shop. The coffee tasted more roasted than our preference and there's not much to eat, but the place is cute and has authentic character. We enjoyed getting to know a new coffee shop in Pittsburgh and then visiting Randyland in the same neighborhood. If ever the dream of the '90s was alive in Pittsburgh, it would be here. And the coffee also happens to be quite good. The cafe is bright and rustic and has the \"everyone knows your name\" feeling. Whatever roast they were using for the espresso that day was a little dark for my taste, but it still made a good latte. I took a bag of beans to go and I'm glad for it; it was a delicious medium roast from El Salvador. The Commonplace roasted beans are no joke. I've been here numerous times and their burgers are so good! That is the main reason they get four stars... Staff is so so and it is definitely not a place to go for anything but a burger they are not really interested at all in having a bar scene(drinks are expensive here especially the bourbon which they have a huge variety of) and as soon as they start slowing down at the end of the dinner rush they start cleaning up like they couldn't get out of their fast enough\n\nGreat food, OK service, and really just a place to eat and head elsewhere to hang out post dinner Bad experience today.     Tues is burger and beer and a bourbon shot. !      12$.     My staff member to busy on his cell phone.     I order a beer doesn't ask if I want to order food !   I finally get another wait staff member I order a burger !   When I get my check it's almost 19$.    And I didn't even get a shot !      It's tues burger night.    So instead of $12 bucks with a shot of bourbon I get a 19 bill with no shot !!   Go figure.   SERVICE is usually great there ,it wasn't tonight and  I won't be back.     The check was fixed when I asked about it but still not offered a shot !!   I WONT BE BACK !! Stumbled upon this gem while visiting Pittsburgh over the holidays and ended up sticking around for a full 5 hours (we blamed the snow, but it was mostly due to not wanting to leave).  Here's why: \n- friendly, down to earth service\n- the best burger I've ever had, hands down (whoa!) \n- great happy hour prices (and sizes of plates!) \n- cozy, polished atmosphere without feeling pretentious \n- a touchtunes jukebox (okay, sometimes this can be a bad thing, but my friends and I greatly appreciated it)\n- great craft cocktails (try their barrel aged selections) and equally delicious beers, along with generous pours of wine \n\nDo yourself a favor and check this spot out! We have been going to Benjamin's for a few years now and this is by far our favorite burger joint in the Burgh!  We found this place by going to a Yelp event years back where we got to try a lot of their food menu items.  After that event we knew we had to come back and try it out for ourselves.  We did and we just keep coming back.\n\n     You have to park on the street for Benjamin's but we have never had a hard time finding street parking.  We usually park at the most a block away.  If you come here on Sunday's or after 6pm it's free to park on the street in Pittsburgh.\nWhen you walk in the bar is along the right side or you can seat down at a table on the left if you prefer that.  There is a nice area in the back part of the restaurant to lounge and eat at a table as well but we always go straight to the bar to eat!\n\n     These burgers are great and that's why we travel from the burbs to come all the way here.  We used to order their shrimp and grits as an appetizer to start but we don't anymore.  My wife got an allergic reaction after eating them and I had to run and I mean literally run to Rite Aid to go get her some Benadryl.  I'm sure it was nothing that they did but she just had a bad reaction so we haven't ordered that since.  \n\n     My wife loves their Candied Jalapeno Burger.  She always thinks she should try something else but just like our recent visit I told her if it isn't broke don't fix it!  So she ordered it again and loved it.  I usually go with the BBQ burger.  This last time I went with their Kentucky Bourbon instead.  Their burgers are so good I just didn't' want the bbq to take from the flavor.  I made the right choice.  This burger was so juicy and just right.  I'll be ordering it the next time we visit.  \n\n     The one complaint that I have would be their side dishes.  They have a bar side grill that they do all their cooking on.  That's great and I like that there are no fryers or fried food.  Just I still want some fries with my burger.  I eat healthy usually so maybe even baked fries or sweet potatoes fries would work.  That's the only thing missing for me here at Benjamin's.  \n\n     The bar area is nice and they have one TV in the front of the bar and two in the back.  Probably not the best spot to watch a game but it's still decent.  The bartenders are usually good and they seem nice.  We have noticed that they do get caught up in conversations or watching jeopardy while  on the job but I still love this place.\n\n     If you're tired of all of the chain restaurant burgers and want a truly great burger come to Benjamin's.  You won't be disappointed! Best veggie burger you'll ever have, and the sweet onion bisque is to die for! Also gluten free friendly! Food=3.5 \nService= 4 \nSo I guess I'm rounding up to a 4. \n\nCame for a birthday dinner on a Tuesday night. The interior is fancy. We had two servers waiting on our table. They were attentive and friendly. We started with oysters. They were just ok. Not bad, not the best, just ok. I also had the Greek salad. The salad was delicious. It was chopped up like a chopped salad which helped me avoid the awkward wide mouth salad eating situation. I ordered the petite filet medium. It was cooked perfectly and very flavorful. We shared the lobster Mac and cheese. It was horrible! I don't know how you can mess up anything with lobster in it. Oh wait yes I do. You skimp on the lobster! There was also an abundance of onions in the lobster Mac and cheese. I like onions but these were so large and over powering.\n\nIt was a good meal but Ruth Chris and Eddie Merlots are still my 1 & 2! I always love coming to this place before an event. I am a greedy, Cookie Monster and this place has everything I want. \n\nMy friend and I went before the Steelers-Browns Game and they had a few items featured from Cleveland on the Buffett. Honestly, you can get those same items-perogies , sauerkraut, kielbasa in Pittsburgh-but how about an A for effort! They were really good for a buffet. \n\nI feel like the Asian fusion side could have been a bit fresher like the rest of the food. For some reason, that side tasted too pre-prepped. \n\nThe dessert bar is amazing! Tons of different kids of dessert for everyone. The also have gelato! Go on Sunday's so you can get their mimosas for $1! Pretty good buffet. I really enjoyed the Philly and California rolls. The meat cutting station was tasty and the meat was moist and cooked just right. They have plenty to offer from pizza to Mongolian. The real treat is the dessert area. They are all small portions but all well made and enjoyable. They have a great selection of gelato, cakes and pies. First visit here and I was happy enough with the variety/price/quality.\n\nCame on a Saturday evening for a price of 19.99 each which includes the buffet and non-alcoholic beverage.  I'd say it was a good deal considering we usually spend about that for a dinner out.  \n\nThe staff is very friendly.  We sat our receipt on the table as we made our way to the buffet and when we got back to our table, our drinks were sitting there ready for us.  Our server introduced herself and frequently checked to see if we needed refills on beverages and she was efficient in clearing our plates before we returned with newly loaded ones.\n\nThe variety was good I thought -- there are separate stations for different types of foods -- Italian, American, Salads, Asian, Desserts.  We asked waitstaff where we got plates and were given our instructions in a very friendly manner.  We immediately headed to the Asian station where a sushi chef helped us with salmon sushi and directed us to where we could get soy sauce and wasabi, then I loaded up on fried rice, some noodles, pork, and pot stickers and secured some chopsticks.  Next up was some salad, mashed potatoes, prime rib, and mixed vegetables.  Was too full for the Dessert section.  \n\nNo complaints at all. Was in for lunch today and really enjoyed all the selection at the buffet.  Servers were friendly and if it had not been raining, the view would have been great!\n\nWell worth the visit if you are on the North Shore! Came here to say the crab Rangoon is the best I've ever had,  by a mile.   What sets it apart is it's not too crunchy to deal with.   It is perfect. \n\nHad the red curry with chicken also,  it was very good. \n\nBut the Crab Rangoon.   Mind blowing. Best Thai food in This area. Loved it so much. Service and environment is also great!!! Strong recommend! This is my go to restaurant for Pad Thai in Pittsburgh. I always order extra chicken. Me and a few friends decided to get takeout from Nicky's in the north side while we were doing some work one street away. This place has been hyped up to me by a few people, and I am a huge fan of Thai food, so I was pretty excited to experience Nicky's.\n  I placed my order over the phone for 3 lunch specials which included an order cashew chicken, an order of panang curry, and the spicy basil noodle. We all ordered spice level 6. We got to Nicky's in about 10 minutes and all of our food was ready. It smelled great and we were very excited to dive in. \n   I must say the quality of the food was severely underwhelming. My noodles were like a heaping pile of steamed mush with almost no flavor. It was also not spicy AT ALL. I had to drench it in sriracha for both spice and flavor! My buddy said his curry was very bland and had almost no flavor. My friend who got the cashew chicken said he did enjoy his though! So get that!! \n   Another one of my friends got a dinner portion of kao soi a couple hours later even though I warned him of our lunch experience. He should have listened. He was upset he was charged $14 for a super bland dish. He said the curry sauce tasted diluted or something. \n   Maybe it's because we got takeout? Maybe it would be better if we ate in? Maybe the downtown location is better? I don't know, it's hard to bring myself to go back. Ive had FAR better thai in Pittsburgh. I wish I had realized that Nicky's has a lunch version of their menu sooner, because we find it quite sufficient as compared to the full menu. Since it's still pretty extensive but with lower prices overall (plus a soup or salad with most items), there's no reason not to! We chose the rice soup to start with, and it was so hearty, being seasoned with some herbs and spices and some pieces of meat. Our entrees were the phad see eaw and wild curry. The former was made just as well as you can find in many other Thai restaurants. The wild curry came with an assortment of different vegetables; it was interesting because it lacked coconut milk and was more like a spicy soup. They also came with a crab rangoon each, which I found kind of weird, but it was an interesting bonus. The food here tends to be on the sweeter side, so that's something to keep in mind. Love the atmosphere of the outdoor patio! Great food and staff! Crab Rangoons and Spicy Noodles are to die for. I got the pad thai here, because I'm *that person* that always gets pad thai when I go to Thai restaurants. And I got it at a level 0 on the spicy-scale. Man, I wish I would have got a level 2 or 3. At level 0, their pad thai is REALLY sweet. But otherwise, their service is EXCELLENT. My water glass was always full and the staff was ridiculously friendly and warm. The service is sub par, the drinks are over priced, the bar is over crowded. These are all things to be expected of a trendy place. The thing that really got me was I showed up at 11 47, an employee told me the kitchen closed at midnight and when I asked the bar tender for a menu she said the kitchen was closed. It says online the kitchen closes at midnight...I understand wanting to be done with a shift, but that's just ridiculous. Bartender with tattoos and man bun REFUSED to call us a can when we said we couldn't drive....said we had 4 people we could use our own phones....our phones were dead which we told him...he was terrible and should be FIRED! Thank you to Jackie nice female bartender who eventually did call us a cab! I am so glad that I didn't find this place as soon as we got to town because I am afraid that I wouldn't have eaten anywhere else. The day we found it we went for lunch and then back for dinner. The pizza and pepperoni rolls were both fresh and hot. The staff was friendly and helpful. We were there on a Sunday during a Steelers game, but the service was still plenty fast. If you are looking for a great meal with fresh, homemade ingredients then this is your place. So good! We just finished a tour of the National Aviary and looked for cheap, good eats nearby. Being New Years Eve day, we called first and the girl at the register told us they were closing in an hour, so we hightailed it over there and man we are glad we did!\n\nMy brother is a vegetarian and he was delighted to see the strictly veggie/vegan board on the wall. He got the veggie chilaquiles with fried egg and I got a hard shredded beef taco and soft carnitas taco. He loved his chilaquiles, it was too big to finish so he took it home and ate it before starting NYE partying. The meats in my tacos were delicious, tender and moist with great flavor with spices that didn't overwhelm the beefy/porky goodness. \n\nAlso got an order of chips, salsa, and guac...everything was super fresh! The salsa is very mild but still has flavor, and their specialty salsas have a kick! I got the medium and had a good tingle going on, while my bro got the habanero pineapple and devoured it while noting he'll regret it in the morning.\n\nThe service was wonderful, I wish I had caught the name of the girl at the register, because she was so nice and welcoming! Usually when you come in an hour before close, restaurant staff can get surly, but she was genuinely nice and explained various things on the menu. She even indulged my brother's need to wear the taco suit for a pic. If I'm ever back in the area, will definitely visit again! For a girl who loves street tacos, these weren't bad! Definitely not the best I've ever had, but what I expected to get at a Mexican restaurant in Pittsburgh. I got two tacos- one carnitas, one shredded chicken. Spicy! Their tacos are $3.25 each which is a bit on the pricier side, but they were loaded, and two were very filling. I also got an order of the chips and guac, which was also a bit expensive, but worth it. \n\nThey have a ton of vegan and vegetarian options. \n\nAs far as seating goes, there's not many options, but it's perfect if you're looking to get a quick and super casual bite. \n\nThe staff was very friendly! If I were to go back I would probably get the chorizo- it seems like that might be what they're known for! Pretty good!  Wiener Schnitzel was tender and a good size portion. Hot pretzel was soft and hot. A lot better than Haufbrauer especially the ambience. A little pricey though. The pierogies I ordered were top notch. Potato and cheese filling topped with fried onions and a sour cream sauce with onions was shear perfection. DH had the sausage trio and thought it was good, but not the absolute best he's ever had. Child had kid's hotdog and fries which she ate with great gusto. \n\nAtmosphere here was kitschy and perfect, a little run down but quintessential burgh. I would definitely come back for the pierogies! Best dive in Northside, cool place, great prices, and cool vintage look ! Defiantly recommend if u looking for a good dive! Good: Food was pretty good overall. Blackened Salmon was one of the best I've ever had.. Sides portion are great. Good cozy vibe.  Bad: waitstaff was horrible, order was asked us 3 times. Upon packing up leftovers a full bowl of greens were dropped.  I proceeded to clean up own mess, with no assistance from staff that seen incident. NO attempt to replace literally full order of greens nor even a apology and offer to take off check..  Its good customer service to make all attempts to fix a incident before customer leaves.. 2 times visiting this location and I wont be back. I've been meaning to go to Carmi's for about 3 years, and finally made it there. Our server was Ty, and he was very nice and helpful. There is a sign that lets you know that the food is made fresh, and that it may take a while. It was absolutely worth the wait. We got chicken and dumplings, fried chicken, meatloaf, two servings of Mac n cheese, two pieces of cornbread, one serving of mashed potatoes, and one serving of fried corn. What impressed me the most was how well everything was seasoned. Nothing was even remotely bland. They aren't afraid of salt and pepper. I'm not big into cornbread, but I would eat this cornbread any time. Fried chicken was juicy and had a nice crunchy breading, potatoes were awesome, gravy was super smooth, meatloaf was so unique and melted in your mouth, corn was nice and crisp, and the Mac n cheese was just what you would expect... perfect! Eat here, like right now. Make sure you come ravenous because there is plenty of food We've visited the Modern Caf\u00e9 a couple times, always after eating next door so I can't comment on the food.  I have looked at their menu before and it seems like your general bar grub.  Modern Caf\u00e9 is a nice stop for drinks.  They offer a large variety of bottled beer and a rotating draft list, along with a stocked bar.  There aren't a ton of beers on tap, maybe 12, but usually they have one or two that I like.  \n\nThe setup is cool but creates some bottlenecking of people around the bar.  This past weekend when we stopped in I had to fight a crowd to get to the bathroom since that many people were just standing and talking.  This wouldn't be a big deal but there were a bunch of tables further back, past the bar, where they could congregate and be out of the way instead of being a fire hazard.   \n\nAll in all, not bad place to stop for a drink after a good meal in the North Side.", "stars": 3.7}, "Oakland": {"year": 2017, "text": "Loved this place! Very small but the tiny donuts make up for it! Lots of different flavors & they are packed with each flavor! We got two dozen and tried almost all of them! This review may not be really fair since all I have ever ordered here has been bubble tea (I do not like Chinese food in general). I always get the mocha bubble tea, and it is always consisten and pretty good. After moving from California to Pittsburgh, it was hard to find a good bubble tea. But I finally achieved my mission! This is a perfect spot for a light lunch/brunch. We usually order one savory crepe each (salmon, mushroom, cheese) and share a sweet one for dessert. And they have French cider! Perfect to accompany the crepes! I just wish the prices were a bit cheaper so we could visit more often. Not as in love with this place as I used to be. It is still convenient and a cool experience if you've never had crepes before, but it's alright.\n\n(review from 12/24/15) seriously? 7 bucks just for one scope of rice and Less then 10 pieces of chicken? How do you train your employee to serve food?! The girl makes mistakes and never listen carefully to customers! I love chipotle very much, but this time this place makes me so sad. I have gone here a few times before and the food was OK I mean it's chipotle. But I went yesterday and I seem to have food poisoning a few short hours after eating a steak burrito with dairy (cheese sour cream). This is the first time of the 5-6 times I have been here, but wouldn't return after this unpleasant ordeal. My friends who had chicken/steak bowls also felt unwell after eating here for dinner. So good! It's a little stand outside of the grocery store. Different meats each day. I got chicken and BBQ beef. The tortillas are warmed on the grill in front of you and after your taco is put together, there's another stand where you can add different salsas and toppings. \n\nTacos are $2.50 each and definitely worth it! Super friendly staff, and great coffee! Stepped in on a whim and walked out with an excellent almond latte. Look forward to coming back! Cool little place, nice atmosphere and staff. Great coffee too, go check em out! Fantastic coffee and in a great location in Oakland. \n\nIt's great to finally have a high quality coffee option in the Oakland area. Was excited to try this new coffee shop in the Oakland area. A very small shop with not a lot of seating. The menu is pretty basic with lattes, espresso, mocha, etc. I got the medium mocha because the small was super tiny. It was $4, which is around the same price of Starbucks. \n\nThe staff was super friendly and definitely made me want to come back. I was also happy to see a cute heart on my mocha. My mocha was great, not too sweet and could still taste some of the coffee. Overall, a nice change from the classic Starbucks or Dunkin on Forbes. I know I will be back! If you haven't checked out this coffee place yet, you absolutely have to! Very conveniently located  near all of the major hospitals in Oakland, it's one of the best coffee places in town. The owners are extremely nice and knowledgeable. I'm thrilled to have a great coffee shop in Oakland, and I'm especially lucky to have it right next to my office! It is also very reasonably priced. The coffee is unbelievably good, so support the local business! Fantastic beans. Not really a sit-down coffee shop, but there are plenty of those in Oakland already. Redhawk is the place for delicious espresso. Awesome new coffee place. We have lots of coffee shops around here already, but this place is my new favorite. A little pricey but worth every penny. I never get a place to sit, so adding more seating would be good. Love this place and the coffee is so good! I don't usually care for being a coffee snob but I honestly can drink it black because it's so good. Expected prices to be too high for me but they are really fair. Medium coffee is $2 and lattes are $3-4. It's also great to support the new business. Highly recommend trying this out and supporting the local business. Great coffee, friendly and good service. So glad to have an independent coffee place in Oakland! Will support as much as possible! I tried Redhawk Coffee for the first time when they were giving out free coffee from their truck on Election Day. Went to the new location this morning since it's very close to my dorm. The employees were very friendly and attentive, the coffee is delicious, and the setting is very quaint. Nice little coffee shop. Go support a local business and try this place. I'm happy to see some great coffee in Oakland. The coffee was very good, the shop has a nice vibe. Very friendly and helpful Am vegan with gluten free lifestyle. There were many items on their menu that I loved. We had pumpkin pear vegetarian gluten free soup which was yum! Had many sandwich options and we loved zesty pineapple sandwich. Will visit again Eat Unique is OKAY. The food is good, really good. The problem is their service. It takes 15+ minutes to get your sandwich if you're lucky, which is delicious by the way. There are two registers, one in the front where a long line forms and another hidden one in the back where there is constantly someone yelling that it's open. People just stand around forever, unsure of where to go and what to do. There are other similar restaurants on Craig street (even Starbucks) who have a similar pre-order, wait for your food to be ready, type-style and everyone does it better. Don't order anything from the grill if you're in a hurry. The food definitely makes up for the service, but even so, I've taken friends there to lunch and actually been embarrassed. It's not an aesthetically pleasing place to linger around and hang out for any longer than 30 minutes.\n\nThat being said, it beats all the chains on Craig and the pesto chicken sandwich keeps me coming back. So underrated! I get a lamb gyro here pretty often. They're fast, delicious, and open late -- so it's a great late night food option when you don't feel like eating pizza or American food when you get hungry on the late night. They have a wide variety of items and the prices are reasonable. I go about once a month and I'll definitely be going more often. Got Yelp take out tonight.   Average delivery time (an hour from order to getting at my door).  Food was good.  Had a traditional gyro,  Sweetie got a chicken gyro.  We also had the cigars (4 in the container) so good,  sooooo good.   Falafel was good,  probably a better thing to order at the location,  was not hot by the time I got it.  Got pistachio and walnut baklava (4 little chunks in each container.   The were both very good.  Will be ordering there again. I finally found drunken noodle in Pittsburgh! Yeah! The environment is nice and cute. It is located right close to school of medicine, which is very convenient for us to have meal after courses. The staff and service is nice here, too. Ordered a bagel sandwich. Only one person waiting before me but took 25 minutes to come out. My name was either spelled or pronounced incorrectly (which I wouldn't fault them for particularly) but I didn't realize the guy was calling my name at first... As a result, I didn't walk up until he called a few times, and when I went up to receive it, he must have been annoyed and basically threw my sandwich at me and huffed away as I was apologizing. The sandwich was adequate, but not worth the service by any means. You know when you get that late night sweet tooth but everything has already closed? Yeah, this is your place. It's open until midnight every single night, so your inner fat kid can rejoice. \n\nInside is your typical, colorful fro-yo place with a multitude of flavor and topping options. My personal favorites are pistachio and salted caramel topped with cheesecake and brownies bites. Maybe throw some fruit on top to convince myself I'm being healthy. I'm guilty of layering on as much as possible, only to forget that it's charged based on weight. It can get slightly expensive, but it's a small price to pay for happiness.\n\nMy only gripe is that they should offer small tester cups for the fro-yo. Otherwise, I end up using my laser focus to pour the tiniest dollop out of the machine and licking the inside of my bowl just to decide if I like the flavor. Also, judging from pictures, the Craig Street location looks a bit nicer. I don't think there's much to say. A good variety of choices (flavors & fruits), a clean and bright atmosphere, and the cheapest froyo place I have ever been too. My friend was surprised that he only had to pay less than $3 for a heavily stacked small cup.\n\nI've seen some complaints about the cashier but whenever I go (usually after 6pm), there's a polite older man who's attentive and can do customer service just fine. The first time I came we had fun but the service from a new host wasnt great. But this time we were lucky enough to have Omega. He completely changed my, and my friends', opinions on this place.  He was very attentive and kind. He was so friendly that we are going to make a point to come when he is working. We really enjoyed talking with him! Thank you for making this place awesome again!!! We will definitely be back. We loved him so much that I made this stupid Yelp account just to compliment him lol This used to be my to-go hookah spot, but recently it's gotten way too expensive. You have to buy a drink/food item, and cork fee is $5. I brought a 40oz beer for $3, but got charged $5 to drink it here! The seating used to be more comfortable too, but is mostly hard plastic seats and some couches. I know they got to pay the bills, but expect to pay $40+ for the most basic hookah experience here. I have never been treated so horribly at a Pittsburgh bar or restaurant than here. They know nothing about customer service or how to greet and interact with other people. I don't know who the gentlemen was who \"greeted\" us, but he had absolutely zero human being skills. When we walked in he just glared at us until we had to break the long awkward silence. There were 3 couples sitting on couches scattered around. He put is in the corner by the kitchen on a bench. We asked to move to a couch and he rudley replied no and that they don't let couples sit on the couches when clearly every other group in there was a  couple on a couch. Oh and it was 7pm and absolutely dead- and it is clear why.  With that we left and will never be back. Do not go here! I've been wanting to try this place for a few years after seeing it on Man vs Food as well as hearing from one of my friends who grew up in Pittsburgh. Many of the students on campus told me that this is the best sandwich ever too. And after trying it, I can see why college students would like it - portion size is off the charts. But it really doesn't taste like much to me.\n\nThe appetizers are pretty good though - the loaded tater tots and fries are really flavorful and hot out of the fryer. The fried cheese triangles are really good too if you like fried gobs of mozzarella (and let's be honest, who doesn't?).\n\nBut the sandwich? It's an experience to be sure as its a Pittsburgh icon but I think its a one and done thing. Bread is soft italian bread but so soft that it can't hold up to the mass of stuff inside. I got a capicola and egg and the meat was a pretty good amount, but it still dwarfs the contents of the fries and slaw. The slaw is pretty good actually - I don't normally like slaw either. But when you got about 3 inches of fries to go through that are a bit limp and not crisp and unsalted, its really hard to taste the sandwich from top to bottom - you just taste bland fries. A lot of our group couldn't finish their sandwich cause it was just too much for them and I can see why. The wife and I had a good time at BJ. The vibe of the place is dim and intimate... the kind of place to take a hot date to  the food was lit the burger was quite good, but the tempura blossoms really stole the show  the service was exceptional, never did we want for anything. Recommended! This place hits the target on quality,quantity and customer service. I've been eating here for years and its one of the top food trucks in the city serving the best indian cuisine. Delicious and affordable! I have had vegetable korma (my most favorite food here), palak paneer, and palak + potato (forgot the Indian name: it is the same as palak paneer except it has potatoes instead of cheese) chicken tamarind, etc. They always taste good. Although the sauce is not always consistent: sometimes too much tomato paste in a sauce that is supposed to be more creamy or vice versa, but I do not care since still the food tastes great! My go-to lunch spot when on campus. Keep it up! idk why a Yogurt place is the best Ramen I've had in Pittsburgh, but holy moley it was freaking fantastic! As per the usual, checked this place out because of the awesome yelp reviews and I was NOT disappointed! Four different types of noodles, many different combinations you can make for the broth, tons of different additions, some BAMF kimchi, and just I was in heaven - in a little college area yogurt shop! I ate that whole bowl and couldn't even eat yogurt after! But I'm definitely going to be back for the crepes (both savory and sweet!), so I'll update y'all then :)))\n\nAlso, you can believe my review because apparently all of my end punctuation was exclamation marks and I don't even want to go back and edit it for variety. I was thoroughly surprised by this place. Like everyone else said, they do ramen and crepes as well as frozen yogurt! My friend and I did the noodle bar and I thought it was pretty good! Granted, I have never had \"authentic\" ramen from Japan; so I had nothing to compare it to. Regardless, the flavors were good, the toppings were tasty, and the broth was refreshing! The noodles were cooked perfectly too and it was a decently sized portion. And it's not all that expensive either, I definitely look forward to coming here more often whenever I'm craving my ramen fix. Came here with a group of friends for dinner. Food was excellent and the service was even better! The tilapia with the apricot glaze was very flavorful and was served with a side of spinach and potatoes. Will definitely be back! The first time I ever ate here was about 2 years ago. I sat at the bar and had an amazing time talking to Donny. Then the food came and I fell in love. Everything is made from scratch with love, and you can really tell!!!!! I raved to everyone who would listen to me about this place. It's a warm, welcoming environment and I 100% recommend you all come here! Went here tonight with a groupon. I personally found the atmosphere interesting and cheerful (there are several decorations all around including some swords/paintings). I particularly liked the fireplaces. The entrees included a salad and bread which was nice. I got the pollo Romano as my entree and thought it was very good with a good sized portion. Service was also very attentive. Plan to go back! Food: we tried the ricotta noodles and we were disappointed. It tasted like bland uncooked dough. We appreciated that our entrees came with shared bread and a salad on the side. However, it was a cheap/cold baguette, like you get from Walmart, while we were expecting it would be made from scratch in the kitchen. The salad had too much seasoning and was made with vegetables that were most likely coming from a can.\n\nAtmosphere: we sat by the gas fireplace which was pleasant. However, we found the decoration ugly and messy. Guns, swords, skulls and pirates on the wall were clashing with the rest of the decoration.\n\nService: Worst service ever. The waiter was pushy and kept watching us. When it was time to sign the check, the waiter was standing next to us telling us how much we should give him as tip (seriously?) He checked what we put as soon as we stood up.\n\nAvoid yourself the trouble, try another restaurant. Also check the pictures I posted with the menu for Friday night. Quite overpriced IMHO, with the cheapest entree starting at $21. The outside is iffy - heck - the inside is iffy as well, but the food is tasty, quick and reasonably priced. Nothing to write home about, but a solid \"A-OK\" meal if you're craving Asian food. Stopped by after picking my daughter up at Pitt campus. The fries were amazing...and huge. The large order was more than enough for all four of us who were eating there. Definitely recommend these! However, the cheesesteak hoagie (sub) and mushroom cheesesteak hoagie were below average. The meat reminded me of the frozen thin packaged Steak-Ums and it was very tough. Plus, be warned that they charge extra for ketchup...yes, really. You get two containers with a large order of fries, then you have to pay 45 cents for each additional container. Also, restrooms are fairly disgusting, probably because, as my daughter explained, it's a late-night stop after the students hit the local bars.\n\nEntrance is confusing initially. One counter for ordering pizza, one for ordering hot dogs, and a third for subs. Coolers are locked from the front, so you have to wait for the cook (who is also the order-taker) to retrieve your selection. Beer in cans and bottles is available in addition to soda. Smokin hot dogs and fries .. everything is pretty good . Good beer selection .. the dirty O says it all I was there for the lunch buffet yesterday.  Everything was delicious and the staff did a great job! A friend shared some tasty red velvet cupcakes from the bakery, and I was in love! Even though this is quite a ways from where I live, it was worth the trek. I was able to get both some grasshopper cupcakes and a super tasty cupcake parfait! It's basically a cupcake in a cup with cake and icing and, well, it's just perfection. I wish millennium cupcake or a little closer to home but I'm sure my doctor is grateful that it is not. I will be back again for more treats! My second or third time here. The waiting time is a bit long like 15 min for a small drumstick with sweet and spicy sauce. I also had taro milk tea and french fries as sides.\nThe sauce is light spicy which hits me right, but overpowering sweet, french fries a bit too salty. taro milk tea has as always too much tapioca that I cannot finish nor reach.\nThe cashier is friendly. Two stars off for the mediocre chicken and fries and waiting time.\n\nLesson for myself, good milk tea, but no need of tapioca it's a waste, unless I really crave them. Very authentic Chinese food. Can't complain about the food, it is very good. But the environment is noisy, the place is crowded. So the stars are all for the food. Went out with a friend after searching for a decent Chinese place to eat in town. Food is just awesome. The menu selection is quite good. Ambience inside is great.\n\nCons: Parking is an issue on weekdays. Paid parking available but generally filled up. Waiters struggle in understanding you if some customization to the food is needed. If you went to Pitt or CMU, you are familiar with Lulu's Noodles. Heck- if you went to school anywhere in Oakland, you are familiar with Lulu's Noodles. Lulu's will always hold a special place in my heart, because coming here with one of my friends in undergrad was one of the first times that I ever chose a more \"Thai\" style restaurant over a traditional Americanized Chinese restaurant (I've matured a lot more now). Back then, I adored this place because I really didn't have anything else to compare it to. Now that I have explored many Thai restaurants, I will say that I still like Lulu's, but I'm not as obsessed as I was back in undergrad. There's nothing wrong with the food here- it's always delicious, the staff is extremely friendly and the menu is totally affordable. It's just not the best thai food I've ever had. If I find myself hungry in this end of Oakland and I have enough time to sit down and have a meal, I will go to Lulu's and I will enjoy my experience there. But I won't drive across the city for it, if I'm not already near it. You catch my drift? Like the other reviewers have posted, for AYCE ($23), it doesn't get better than that. It's your mom and pop, the classic Chinatown-esque spot for hot pot. Having been to Chinatown in San Francisco, Boston, and New York, it's not at that level but it will do when you're in Oakland and need something to fill the void. One thing that sucks is that a lot of food is wasted because they bring out pre-set foods to your table. They also serve Cuban food in the front if you're looking to spice up the variety. The food was great and the hot pot was such a fun experience! The prices were very reasonable especially considering all the food we got. I would highly recommend Top Shabu-Shabu! My first trip to a place like this. I love food so I knew I couldn't go wrong with a place like this. Went with a group and it worked out well. We were all able to pick everything we wanted to try and had an entire table full. For a price of $22.99 a person it is a good deal. Make sure you go when you have time to enjoy and take your time. I don't know whose idea it was to start a Starbucks in UPMC Presby, but it was indeed a smart cookie who must have thought of such an idea indeed. Located on the 1st floor of UPMC Presby, this place is usually most busy during the early mornings when most employees start their shift (6 AMish) and also during the afternoon rush when friends/family visit patients in the hospital. Lines at these times can often be long, but I'm actually pleasantly surprised at how quickly the baristas here can churn out orders and do a pretty decent job. In the number of instances that I've ordered something from here, I usually find myself not waiting too long to receive my order (not busy - 1-2 minutes, busy times - 4-5 minutes). It's kind of a pity this place doesn't participate in mobile ordering though ... I would probably use it all the time were I to work here when coming here. There is a decent amount of seating, but there's also seating that spills out next to the elevators (hospital provided couches, tables, and whatnot) so it's a good place to have meetings with fellow colleagues over coffee. BBQ pizza and Bayou Blues wings(dry rub) are a must have!!! Wings seasoned Perfectly!!! So sad that their late night menu is now $6 instead of $5. However, their chipotle polka pierogies are still worth it. The pierogies are filled with potato and cheese and then cooked in a spicy chipotle sauce. The caramelized onions, sour cream, cheddar, and bacon elevate these from just normal pierogies to a cheesy delightful explosion in your mouth. The kitchen staff is very irritating because I had to make a couple trips back inside to have my take -out to be right. Very unprofessional and horrid. This D&D happens to be located near campus, right under Pitt's Litchfield Towers. As such, it is massively busy especially during the early morning hours before classes and afternoons when afternoon classes finish. There is an app available that you can use to place your order ahead to skip the line, which can be long at times and receive your order. I frequently utilize this option to save on time that is better spent elsewhere. Things I like about this particular location: they get and prepare your order quickly and efficiently, donut selection is plentiful (best time is early morning for best availability of selection). Cons: could be better kept more frequently as students tend to frequent and leave a bit of a mess at times and when the line is long, it can go out the door (which isn't fun during the winter when it's cold outside). Hence, the reason for the rating This is your slightly-above-the-average American bar food. Burgers, grilled salmon, and some vegetarian and chicken dishes. Nothing is over the moon, and nothing is too terrible. My favorite food item here is their waffle fries. Usually I get the grilled Salmon sandwich. It is good, except that I don't like the bun that comes with it; it tastes sweet. But then again, it is an American bar food, not a French cafe. But, really! Do they really have to add sugar to bread? It is just gross!! Visited piada's for the first time after seeing their grand opening posts on my facebook feed. Had the chef's favorite piada with crispy chicken. I actually liked it a lot! I got a free side of a parmesan stick after showing them the facebook event that you can get a free side. My friend got a small basil pesto pasta with steak. The sundries tomatoes in there were a tad salty but nevertheless delicious. She got cannoli chips as her free side. The chocolate chip cream they gave on the side had like two chocolate chips in there which was to my disappointment. The Parmesan stick wasn't as good as I expected but the entrees were delicious. I loved my piada wrap and I loved the few bites of pasta I snuck from my friend. The steak and chicken were both really delicious. The pastas and piadas don't come with any meat or calamari or anything like that from the start. You have to add it on for a few extra cents or bucks like $0.99 or $1.99, something around there. The waitresses and chefs were all really friendly and the chefs walked around as we ate constantly asking us how we liked our food and if we needed anything we could call them. :)) overall, it was a pretty satisfying lunch and I'd most likely come back!! Went in tonight for the first time and was blown away by the service. ALL of the workers had beautiful smiles across their face, I felt very welcomed. The fall steak avocado piada was recommend to me and I would give it a 12/10, SO tasty. The place had a great ambiance and with a fresh and clean feel to it. Prices are very reasonable and portions are very satisfying. Definitely going back soon!!! This restaurant recently opened, so when I went (around 7:30pm on a Wednesday) there was a long line. The menu has around 10 basic options with plenty of meat options, as well as side options. The ambiance is very nice and all the employees were very friendly! I ordered the diavolo pasta with crispy chicken and I was very pleased! The pasta is not undercooked or overcooked and the diavolo sauce (while a tad spicy) was delicious. The crispy chicken had great flavor and a nice crispy outside. You definitely get a solid amount of pasta for the amount you pay. Overall, I'd definitely come here again to try their piadas and salads!\n\n**Fun tip: You can also ask to add pasta in your piada! Came here for the grand opening VIP event. Was super excited to try this new addition on Forbes. They scanned our tickets and then we got in line. The restaurant was heavily staffed and everyone was very friendly. The interior was very rustic modern with lots of wood and white. \n\nI ordered the chef's favorite piada with fried calamari and my friend ordered the spicy diavolo pasta with salmon. Once I ordered the piada, the lady heated up the thin piece of dough on a huge griddle. Then, it was passed down a long assembly line. Another lady put the spicy diavolo sauce and parmesan sauce. Then someone else put the lettuce, peppers, and finally the calamari was put on. \n\nThe piada itself was very different from anything I had before. The calamari was cooked well and not too chewy. The sauces added a nice tangy spicy taste. It was also surprisingly filling. My friend's spicy diavolo pasta with salmon was pretty big. The salmon was lacking flavor. \n\nWe were also able to sample the sides once we sat down. The lobster bisque was very creamy and tasted great. The parmesan dipping sauce for the cheese stick made the cheesestick. Finally, we had the cannoli chips, which were a sweet delicious ending. Overall, it was a great event Today was their official opening day and this place was packed!  All the staff were very friendly and they seemed well prepared for the opening although the line was quite long.  Staff came out to greet you with menus and to help answer questions and there were a ton of staff behind the counter . The menu has a nice range of items from a variety of pasta, salads, and sandwiches and you could choose the type of protein to top your pasta. All the pastas and salads were mixed fresh there as you watched and were prepared very quickly once you placed your order.  I got the Italian sausage as my topping on the basil pesto pasta and you could see the sausage being grilled right there.  All the staff behind the counter were super friendly and did not seem overly stressed or overwhelmed by the huge crowds of people which continued well past peak lunch time.  The pastas come in a large and a smaller size which is really nice since the large size is quite generous.  All the ingredients appeared very fresh.  They also had some garlic cheese or pepperoni breads made out of their signature piata flat bread which looks like a crepe.  They also had cannoli chips as a dessert item, which were delicious.  In addition to regular soda they have a few Italian traditional sodas which was a nice together.  There is a nice clean dining area with large tables where people can eat in or take their items to go.  This is right across from my office and I'll definitely be back here! Absolutely spectacular. Friendliest staff I've ever encountered in a restaurant who were genuinely excited.   Definitely a breath of fresh air for the food selections in the Oakland area.  I genuinely shed a tear as I was eating the pasta.  My favorites were the sausage and the cannoli chips.  The Italian soda fountain compliments the food wonderfully.  13/10. Came here for the VIP Pre-opening event. I got the Chef's favorite piada with calamari and it was delicious. I wasn't expecting them to give me so much calamari in it since I got it for free, but they didn't skimp at all! The food is flavorful and the staff is friendly and helpful as many customers who have never been to a Piada may not be familiar with the food. Prices were super reasonable. Like many people said, it's sort of like a Chipotle for slightly more unique and casual Italian foods. I'll definitely be back. I came for the grand opening VIP event on Saturday. I have never been to a Piada and was kinda just going to see if this would be my new lunch spot or not! I have been getting the emails for a few weeks now and the food looks amazing. I liked how everything looked so fresh and so good! \n\nWe got there right at 6 PM and it was super empty. There was one other table in the restaurant with a few girls but that was it. BUT boy did it really fill up fast! The place was bumping in about 15-30 minutes. We were greeted right away and the door person was really efficient. We got our tickets scanned and looked through the menu. I thought that possibly the door person could have explained the menu and what we were allowed to get or not allowed to get a bit more. I didn't really understand what a Piada was or if we were only getting one thing or half a thing and half another thing. I went back to her to ask. I got my clarification quickly and we ran back into the line!\n\nWe decided to get two different pasta dishes because those looked the best on the menu. \n\nI decided to order the \nBASIL PESTO PASTA:Parmesan alfredo, fresh basil pesto, sundried tomatoes, freshly grated parmesan. I added more sundried tomatoes, extra fresh tomatoes,grilled chicken, and extra pesto sauce. One thing I can say is that the portion sizes are ridiculously huge. The pasta was premade but was not stale at all. The ingredients tasted really fresh and I enjoyed the veggies. I will say that the pesto had a strong taste of oregano. I had my friend also try it and we both decided it was slightly overwhelming, not pesto like at all, just more oregano. The alfredo also was not as strong as I usually like an alfredo to be. It just was not parmesan based it felt. It was just a bit dull. The plate was good, but eh.. I don't know if I would get it again. \n\nMy friend got the\nPESTO POMODORO MEATBALL:100% grass-fed beef meatball, pomodoro sauce, fresh basil pesto drizzle, freshly grated parmesan. She loved the meatball, I thought it was just ok. But we both thought that the red sauce was a lot better than the alfredo. I would get this one again, but maybe with a different meat than the meatball.\n\nI also tried some of their Italian sodas, never again. TOOOO SWEEEETTT for me. I had to dump it out and get some water.\n\nWe also got little samples of the cannoli chips; yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Give me some more of this for sure. The little bit that we got, yummy! And we got to sample the tomato and lobster soups. NOPE. They were too thick. They needed to really be less thick and watered down. The flavoring was too strong. \n\nI will go back again, I know I will. But this time I might want to try out their sandwiches or those good looking salads! Saw that this place had just opened this past Monday and really wanted to try it out as I'm currently on rotation in Oakland. Finally got a chance to pop in today. Unsurprisingly, as this place is currently on the rise (trending since it is new - literally it's still in its first opening week) and I went during the lunch rush (when people are usually on break, either from work or classes), the line was pretty long and translated to a 20-30 minute wait. I do really appreciate that the staff observed this and attempted to make things go faster by passing out menus to those in line and made themselves available to answer any questions customers may have so that by the time you do get up to the front to order, you know what you want for sure instead of standing there taking precious time up to decide. From what I overheard from those in line, this restaurant (chain) has its roots in Ohio and quickly rose to prominence from there. The restaurant concept is mainly based on the piada, a Italian-style type burrito that has its roots in Italy (hence the name), but it also serves other Italian-related options, such as soups, salads, pastas, and so forth. I decided to try a seasonal item called the Fall Steak Avocado Piata, which consists of a piada shell and a rather delightful combo of steak meat, arugula, pancetta, avocado, spicy balsamic aioli, mozzarella, pepitas, and butternut squash. I ended up also adding calamari to it since I wanted to evaluate its quality along with three sticks (Parmigiano Regiatto, Pepperoni, and Garlic Dough Piada sticks). The piada itself was wonderfully made. Ingredients are fresh and the combo that was included in the particular piada was well-thought out. The steak meat was cooked well, fresh, and juicy, which I really liked. I also found the calamari to be of decent quality, not overfried to the point where you feel guilty eating something potentially unhealthy but also not to the point where there is no taste to it. All in all, my mouth felt wonderfully happy and satisfied biting into the piada and all of its wonderful flavors that went well and complemented each other impeccably. The sticks were also pretty good and are excellent sides to complement should you be feeling really hungry. Overall, it was well worth the wait even if the wait was longer than I would have liked. In general, I would recommend going in the early afternoon when not so many people are on lunch break and perhaps the later dinner hours to avoid the dinner rush. The best way I could succinctly describe this place is Chipotle-like Italian style cuisine. Definitely worth a try if you're in the area! Came here for the pre-opening VIP event and would definitely go back.  It's a fast casual style joint that reminds me of Chipotle - except Italian and with fewer decisions as you are going down the line.  They have a few choices each of wraps (piadas), salads, and pastas plus a few seasonal selections and sides.  The standard ingredients for each choice are listed on the menu, so you select what you want, pick your meat, and watch them assemble it - you don't need to provide further direction unless you want it specialized in some way.  \n\nThe place is shiny and new - modern, but with some rustic touches to soften things up a bit.  There are several communal tables, booths, and regular tables throughout.  Staff members were super-friendly and plentiful for the event.  Smiles all around and a willingness to explain, assist, adjust that you don't find everywhere.   \n\nI ordered the fall special piada.  It was absolutely delicious on a seasoned wrap that was freshly warmed and filled with steak, butternut squash, etc.   I appreciated that the arugula was used sparingly - so often, wraps are stuffed with lettuce and little else.  The balance of ingredients was good and it was enough to fill me up without a side or anything.  I also sampled the soups, some sort of cheese bread, and the fall side selection.  The fall side selection was top notch - flavorful and hearty, but not heavy.  I didn't care for the other two, but it could have been that they were samples on a tray that sat a bit.  \n\nThe other thing I didn't care for was the carbonara with grilled chicken that the boyfriend ordered.  The portion was ample, but I'm not sure \"carbonara\" is really the right description for this dish.  It was more of a bland alfredo with a bit of bacon added.  And it was really dry - the pasta to sauce ratio wasn't right.  Skip that and go with the wrap.  Add some Italian peach tea and you have a meal. Came here for the pre opening vip event and got a free meal for me and my boyfriend! I got the pasta pomodoro with a meatball and he got the pasta carbonara and we both really like the food. It was a pretty big portion which is always a plus. The people that work there are super nice also! Definitely will be returning. I went during their VIP Event. The place looked nice and the food was abundant and most important delicious. All the ingredients were fresh. I will definitely return. Great salmon dinner and terrific service at the bar. Went during half off and got the Bianca pizza (savory fig jam, goat cheese, truffle oil and arugula). It's a very good vegetarian option. Could use more cheese, but very good especially for the price.\n\nGot the seasonal cookies and cream cheesecake, it was delicious. The cheesecake was rich and creamy. Definitely a great option for sharing. Great spot for lunch in Oakland. They have the best breakfast sandwich in Pittsburgh. Breakfast sandwiches are available at the small carry out window each morning. The pizza is also excellent. It was my first time here.  It wasn't that busy since we came in around 5:30pm on a Friday night. We were immediately greeted and were shown our booth.  We waited about 10 minutes until the greeter walked by and we asked how do we get our food?  He replied I'll get someone for you(Gee thanks).  After about 5 minutes the waiter came over and he acted like we were bothering him and he had other things to do.  He threw down two pieces of paper and said, these our are specials tonight. \n\nThe food was great but the service was very poor.  We did not feel welcomed at all.  \nStupid me I gave him 20% tip, oh well I am sure it was for the food. On our road trip we opted to stop in Pittsburgh for the night. It was the night after Christmas and the grassy area next to the restaurant was decorated with Christmas trees and lights. This was my first time being here and my boyfriend's second time. I got a soup and a salad, and he got the Slow Roasted Chicken. All was very good and our waitress was very attentive. We were seated with a few of the outdoor area. However, it must've taken the hostess to alert the waitress that she seated us about 15 minutes to come over to our table. This is the only reason why I'm not giving it 5 stars. I admit, I am not very adventurous when it comes to beverages. I drink black tea with honey in it, and not much else. But... I'm very glad I had a meeting scheduled here today! My colleague and I met and she guided me through the process. She highly recommended the boba and the woman behind the counter allowed me to try before I added it to my order. I went with the black tea, lemon flavor, no milk, lychee boba and it tasted like a delicious and fun Arnold Palmer that had the joy of the boba bursts! So, next time I go I may be more open to the other flavors... but, this kind was so good I might stick with it too!\n\nThere is a small case with sweets, but I was so focused on what I would order I didn't make note of what all was available.They also have the same rewards app as Sushi Fuku - so be sure to put in your number to get the rewards! This place has moved down to 2nd place for bubble tea in Pittsburgh (#1 on my list is now Banh Mi & Ti). Even if you get the no sugar option, it's still overloaded with sweetness in my opinion. Still, a vastly superior alternative considering that none of the places near this joint in the Oakland area (i.e. Rose Tea, OE, etc.) come even close ... For the area, it cranks out pretty good bubble tea and satisfies my needs. It's definitely one of the milkiest bobas I've had anywhere, with a very pronounced dairy flavor (given you can use whole milk or half n half, that explains a lot). The tea flavor isn't that strong but the drinks aren't overly sweet either. I really liked the taro milk tea for that reason - almost like drinking a thin milkshake and if you know taro, you know that means asian cookies and cream flavor.\n\nEven though its 15 degrees outside, you'll still leave happy even with a cold drink :) \"Five Guys kicked my arse!\" That's a phrase I like to use immediately after visiting Five Guys. Why? Because they kick my arse and fill my belly with delicious burgers and fries. I always order a \"little\" cheeseburger and devour it like a beast. To me, there's nothing little about that sandwich. And the fries...when I get an order to go, I just pour the bag of fries directly into my mouth. I haven't been to this five guy location since college. While the food is similar to other locations the crowd is always interesting. College students, people visiting the hospitals, and random sketchy people. It's typically messy and crowded. I do enjoy their burgers and fries though! Here's the deal: If you're a college student who doesn't mind being elbow-to-elbow with strangers, poor service from rude hostesses (the servers really do seem to be trying their best), this is your spot. \n\nHonestly, I come here for the nostalgia of my Pitt days 15 years ago. But every time I do, I regret it. I know, it's my own fault for going out in Oakland. \n\nThe hostesses here are almost always surly and dismissive. The blonde one I most recently dealt with was less a hostess and more a referee, explaining all of the rules and regulations that this location has with bill splitting, parties at a table, paying at the bar, whatever. She was far less interested in accommodating us as she was in arguing with us.\n\nOn the bright side, the food was excellent, as always. \n\nAnyway, If you're an adult who isn't trying to pretend you're still 19, hit up the Shadyside or Monroeville locations with the exact same food, more space, and none of the hassle. This location would get less stars if it wasn't on me for knowing better than to come here.\n\nBut if you're a college student, this is your spot. Five stars. I've always been a huge fan of Mad Mex, but I think it's time for them to revamp their business, especially at this Oakland location. Went out tonight after a long day with my 25-year-old friend, who has a very valid NY ID. We were looking forward to drinks and meals, and our waiter refused her service for a margarita. When she asked to speak to the manager, the manager claimed it was a fake, and said \"I'm 28, I know what a New York license looks like.\" Recently, New York updated their IDs to a newer, less flimsy version, so if anything, the state of her older ID showed her age.  \n\nOakland is a college town. My friend and I go out to restaurants and bars with scanners, and there's never any problem. A smart business move would be to invest in a scanner, or provide a more rigorous training in identifying cards from different states. Not only was the manager unable to verify a valid ID, but she was rude about it. This reflects poorly on the restaurant and the management. \n\nI couldn't be more disappointed with this experience. This isn't the responsible way to conduct business in a college town. I work in the restaurant business, I know things can be rough and everyone has a bad day, but this situation was unacceptable and so frustrating. There's no excuse to be denying VALID forms of ID by eye in this day and age. \n\nI've always enjoyed dining at your restaurant, but this experience was beyond unsatisfactory. Please consider making a change, Mad Mex Oakland. it was my first mad mex experience at this location, I ordered steak tacos which was really good. My girlfriend got a chicken enchiladas, it was a huge plate and all fresh. Host Guys at the door really friendly and nice. Place was packed because of the hockey game, its cozy and cool. will def come back While in Pittsburgh I was told to check out Fuel and Fuddle, which is next door. It sadly was closed. So Stacked worked instead.\n\nThey do a build your own burger with a big variety of options including a veggie patty. You check off you choices and they'll bring it all out. They also have a good variety of other choices, appetizers, sides and a good beer selection. Food was tasty and I was happy with the second choice. Service was good too, prices were reasonable.\n\nThat said ... We witnessed a small mouse wander across the dining room and nobody seemed very concerned. So I do hope that is not a regular occurrence. Best pizza take out / delivery in the east end; not the quickest, but the highest quality. Great pizza and fries. Falafel was decent too. We got the steak burrito and falafel sub. Both were really good but the burrito is very small in comparison to the sub. The fries were also amazing. Delivery was also pretty fast, and it took around an hour to arrive. \n\nWe will definitely be coming back! This place might very well be my favorite restaurant in Oakland. Ever single item on their menu is great. Their chicken tenders are homemade, the subs are incredible and the fries are the best I've ever had. I go here at least once a week and I confidently can say they are the best. They actually care about the food they make and their customers. 10/10 would recommend to everyone I know I didn't know about this place until I asked Google where I could get a pork cutlet bowl here in Pittsburgh. And as if answering my prayer for a new ramen spot, this place popped up. I have to say, this tiny hole in the wall is absolutely delicious. I got the shoyu ramen with green onion, bamboo, seasoned egg, and bean sprouts with pork katsu. The soup is absolutely savory and the egg is perfection. The only gripe I have is that the pork is a little too fatty and chewy. But other than that, it's amazing! The appetizers were delicious. The staff was attentive, the drinks were rather delightful and the crowd was tasteful. I would definitely go to this place again and order more. I wish that I had found this place earlier. I plan to visit more often in the coming months. I will definitely bring a date or a group of friends. I love Legume and the adjoining Butterjoint (which will also serve Legume's menu).  Ingredients are fresh and creatively combined, the service is good and the drinks are delicious.  The menu is ever changing but some notable items were great salmon, and cauliflower root veg dish. The burger is always delicious and reliable; sometimes I order that when at the bar side after work for happy hour. The first time we dined at Legume was summer of 2016 during their vegetarian week.  We aren't vegetarian, but the vegetarian items on the menu sounded so good, so we tried them.  We were so impressed that on our return to Pittsburgh this January, we returned to Legume.  We have to say it is one of the best restaurants around...anywhere. Their cocktails were perfect.  The cocktail I enjoyed last summer wasn't on the menu so the waitress suggested one which was excellent. The pickle plate is a must-have for those who love pickled anything. Their beef and kimchi soup was perfectly seasoned.  The fries from Butterjoint (attached bar) were just delicious. We love crispy fries and their fries are far from crispy, but they were just yummy.  We had 3 different entrees at the table.  All were fantastic.  We closed our perfect meal with the heavenly cardamom pot de creme for dessert.  Happiness!! Legume keeps it simple, yet being sophisticated. The balance of flavors is just so natural and amazing. Last night we had a salad to share,a steak and a Spanish fish dish as entrees, and cardamom creme (cannot remember the actual French name) for desserts. We enjoyed the food very much. I just wish the salad was not so tiny. It was reallyy tiny. My first visit. Definitely going back. More than just the standard curry and vindaloo. We ate here for the first time, and my husband is threatening to never eat in another restaurant on this block again. He wants to come back and order the mild chicken dhaba again, and again, and again. I had the medium tarka daal. The garlic naan was well done. Nice service and reasonable prices. We'll be back (obvi). For a cheap, no frills Chinese Buffet, this place rocks. There's about 20 items on the buffet. All of them are yummy. Went their with my Mom and my Child and we all got full. They have a standard setup of stuff plus 2-3 items that they rotate depending on the day of the week. We went on Monday where they had Char Siu (Roast Pork) and Chow Fun.\n\nYou would be surprised that a little hole in the wall buffet like this has such decent grub but you need to check it out. The Cafe has recently re-opened after being remodeled. They have replaced the cafeteria style grill with a sit-down restaurant. This is the first restaurant review I have ever done. I felt compelled to do so because this was such a horrible eating experience. The atmosphere was quite nice and the service was fine but the food was grossly (pun intended) overpriced but wouldn't have been good at any price. \n\nI took my family of 4 there after a day at the museum. All of us were equally disappointed. The daily special was banana pancakes. In order to 'elevate' it they mixed the butter with thyme. Both of the boys, who do NOT have discriminating palates, commented, \"How can you screw up pancakes\". Per their words, \"I had to choke it down.\" I ordered a vegetable pot pie that was so small I could have finished it in a couple of bites. Instead I had to pick through the slimy sauce to get to the vegetables which tasted like they came from a can. The highlight was my wife's salad which was nothing special but was at least 'fine'. \n\nI understand the inflated prices that come with visiting a place like the museum but for $70 I expected better.  For $5 I would have expected better. The old grille was very good and much more reasonably priced.  I would frequently meet people there for lunch even if I wasn't at the museum. Not anymore. Take the 5 minutes and walk over to Craig Street to eat. Best salads I've eaten in Pittsburgh. Get the Farro, Chicken Salad, or or Cheve Chaud. Also, Griddled Sandwich is the best comfort food I've eaten. Make sure you get a bite of the house-madenaturally leavened sourdough bread.", "stars": 4.0}, "Observatory Hill": {"year": 2016, "text": "I love that this bakery is old school.. nothing fancy just the real deal folks.  The donuts are just the best - great selection!! They have muffins too.  The cake is pretty good- moist fresh.

Not a bad place.  I've only eaten in, so I have no feedback on delivery, but I've always been happy.  The signage and decor is something you'd expect to see in an old episode of the A-team but the place is clean and the food is good.  The portions are big and the prices are very reasonable.  The staff is friendly and attentive.  I've usually been there on weekends around lunchtime and the restaurant is always nearly empty.  I hope for their sake it is busier at other times, because it really is good food. We love this place. The staff have become like friends to us. They're always so gracious and attentive and the food never seems to take too long. The spring rolls have shrimp in them but they're great- not greasy and packed with veggies. I usually go with the kung pao or garlic chicken and it is always way too much food. Sit-down dinner quality at cheap delivery prices. I read almost all of the reviews before deciding to visit.  Recurring in the reviews was the phrase \"hole in the wall' type place.  I mistook that to mean 'quaint' or 'unnoticed local gem'.  Now I understand what that means.  It means an accident that happened to something that once before was stable and good.\n\nI visited here at 6:30 p.m. on a Saturday night.  There are  about 20 seating options, 3 were used all the others empty.  First sign I chose to ignore.\n\nThe interior looks like a frozen- in- time 1970's steak house.  Nothing updated, nothing new, nothing fresh.  Second sign I chose to ignore.\n\nThe waiter, a retired white man working on some secondary income source to supplement his retirement, attended to us.  He was loud, very loud.  He was not Asian.  White, and very loud. There was no Asian table or house workers in the front side of things.  Third sign I chose to ignore.\n\nThe food was basic stuff....beef and broccoli and a honey - spicy chicken.  Nothing special in flavor or presentation.  All served on old plates with big metal lids.  Perhaps leftovers from the 1970 steakhouse sale.\n\nI sent all the food back shortly into the meal because it was cold.  The rice was cold, the meat and veggies were cold and even the soup broth was cold.   When was the last time you ate Chinese food that was cold?  It's never cold, never.  This was.   I couldn't ignore that.\n\nThe bill for two dinners, with soup and 4 spring rolls was $54 with tip.  Waaaaaaay beyond what I would ever pay again for a run down dining room that served cold, mediocre food  There are plenty of other places out there. \n\nDon't choose to ignore this review.  You heard it from me.  Not what you want. New & improved! Clean, good service, hilarious staff! Food was fresh & done to perfection Well, let's see what was on the menu: dirty tables, 1 cashier, a guy with 3 badly-behaved boys, whom he let change their orders repeatedly, then ignored them, while they ran around yelling, climbed on booths, opened and slammed freezer doors,  argued amongst themselves. The rest of us had to wait while the one and only cashier disappeared into the kitchen to help with their order, then delivered their desserts. The light over the one clean boith was out, making it really dark at that table. The others were lit, but dirty. Some choice, right? However, the cashier was nice. I wished she had called someone to run the other register, and wish they vould get someone to make a schedule that served the customers. Btw, my cheeseburg was flat, rather dry, and ridiculously hot. My boyfriend and I have never been a huge fan of this Dairy Queen location but it is the closest one so we just deal with the little problems. Tonight was a last straw though. We showed up at 9:35 and the doors were locked. The hours of operation on the door said open till 10 pm. Closing 25 minutes early are you kidding me?  We decided to try the drive thru since It looked open and to our surprise it was. We both ordered blizzards and took about two minutes to make. That wasn't the problem. The problem was when we got them they were half melted. How can a blizzard melt that fast. I wish I was exaggerating when I say this, but honestly it was like ice cream soup. My boyfriend got the New York strawberry cheese cake and only managed to find one strawberry in it. We used to have issues with just the service but now I can officially say I'm done using this location. It's a shame since they just redid the whole thing but the problem seems to lie in management and staff. That's what really needs to be fixed. We absolutely love this place. Its traditional diner food, so don't expect anything flashy. But the pancakes are huge and always melt in your mouth- I especially recommend the strawberry pancakes. Delicious! Lunch options are also good- standard diner food but I've never been disappointed. Haven't had dinner here. It is one of our go-to breakfast spots when we're looking for comfort food! The best thing about eating here was when the waitress said she would not charge us for getting a new breakfast dish after finding a hair in the first one.  Hahahahahahaha.  The second would have been all fruit flies and filthy Windows.   I don't get the good reviews about this place except maybe some people are used to eating trash. Typical American diner fare. Stopped in because I was in the area. Decent food, friendly service. While nothing stuck out to make my dining experience remarkable, I would return if it was convenient. The coolest thing is that they have a drive thru lottery booth right behind the building. If you're feeling lucky you can grab a ticket or two. I love a good diner and Frank & Shirley's does NOT disappoint!  Their pancakes are so yummy, their bacon is perfectly crisp, and the mushroom omelette... *fans self* is SO good.  I grew up in Somerset and thought I'd never find something to hold a candle to my beloved Summit Diner, but Frank & Shirley's fills the void.  The staff is always nice, service is quick, and you can get out the door for under $15.  I've never dabbled in their lunch or dinner items, but maybe one of these days I'll give it a go.  \n\nIf you're looking for a classic diner without the frills, put aside your fear of driving on Route 51 (it's not that bad!!) and get here.  Fun fact:  it's the original Eat 'n Park location... but if you ask me, Frank & Shirley's is the place for smiles.  And delicious omelettes! Had the meatball sub special for my first time.

For the salad, I liked that they went with mozzarella balls rather than a slice.\n\nThe homemade pasta is awesome. We had the bolognese and the arrabbiata. The sauce was thick and flavorful.

Homemade pierogi, specialty polish sausages and quality cold cuts, sliced to order, good stuff. Also , this is a well stocked neighborhood grocery mart, fresh produce, dairy and bakery products, as well as soap, cigarettes, soda and pop , as well as many other useful products for use around the house. Bonus, they have a package to Poland post service here, which is useful for the older Polish residents of the neighborhood. 5 stars! Quality sandwiches! Mack's family has been coming here forever and I finally got to try it. I order an Italian sandwich pretty much everywhere I go since that's what I'm most interested in and this sandwich was great! It's definitely an outdated hole in the wall kind of place, but those are my favorite! Surprising gem in the heart of Polish Hill right across from the Immaculate Heart of Mary church. The sandwiches are quite wonderful and are piled high with tasty things. There are homemade Pierogies and cheeses and lunch meats.\n\nThe staff is quite friendly. \n\nIt's a small place, and there's nothing corporate about this charming cafe, but it's genuine and the great sandwiches will keep you coming back. Don't be a dummy. Just go eat here. The sandwiches are so well made. Get a Braggs drink if you want a pleasant surprise.\n\nAll of the ingredients here are top notch and the care put into the sandwiches really shows. The pickle spear may be the best I have had as well. Fantastic small jewel in polish hill. Great coffee and treats! Attempt the quiche! It is delish.. In addition they make their very own handcrafted ice cream sandwiches. Vegetarian perspective-\n\nLovely hidden coffeehouse and cafe gem in polish hill. We enjoy it most for its food menu which is vegan and vegetarian friendly. \n\nCoffee varies from very good to mediocre. Many drinks are on the cheaper side but volume for a small chai (also mediocre) is very small.\n\nWe love the tempeh rueben, vegan banh mi, and their salads are fresh and generous portions.\nBe aware that on Sunday they don't do their regular full menu and have a brunch special of the day which we shared once and it (a stew) was delicious and very filling.\n\nService is always excellent, baristas are super friendly. There is a bathroom and back room seating. If you live in Pittsburgh, go here right now. Seriously. Everyone go. I'm so glad my friend took me to Lili. I got a simple latte, but it was so wonderful I shed tears of joy, and the environment is really chill and beautiful. Walking into this cafe is a lot like walking into wonderland. The art, pamphlets, music, everything is fantastic. All of the food looks incredible and most, if not all, is vegetarian or vegan. I can't wait to try more of it. \n\nAttached are some niche shops that are also fantastic. \n\nI noticed right away that Lili supports a lot of local places too, and that's the punk thing to do. Local supporting local is a win. \n\nIf you guys can't tell, I'm really excited about Lili. I only wish it were closer. It's not cost prohibitive (cheaper than Starbucks), and it's simply lovely. Go. Now. Brunch here on Sunday is a fixed menu, which we didn't know.\n\nI went to order and said, \"Can I get anything I want?\" and the woman at the register said, \"You can do whatever you want,\" referencing only what I can assume is 'the man' and then proceeded to tell me that no, I couldn't get what I want, it was brunch or nothing. Hahahahaha. We still laugh about it.\n\nAside from that, our food was excellent. It's a cozy place and I would definitely come back to try out their full menu. When I'm allowed, that is :) My friend and I went here for Sunday brunch after visiting the Killer Heels exhibit at the Frick. We were all dressed up in our heels and 1950s dresses...and we did not fit the vibe of the other clientele at all. I loved Lili but my friend felt a bit uncomfortable. It was busy, but we did find a table in the back room. The staff were all very friendly despite the rush. I wished that they would have had the whole menu available-I really wanted to try the burrito! The post toast was great and surprisingly filling-I did add cheese and egg though. The cardamom (n?) latte was amazing and I loved the decor. I personally can't wait to come back, just be ready for a lot of black and tattoos. To each their own :) Love this place. Situated at the bottom of a precarious slope, Lili Cafe is a neighborhood favorite. I knew I would love this place when I saw the entrance display: \"Refugees Welcome.\" It is definitely quite hipster in its ambience - you HAVE to check out the inside. Great place to work as well - fast WiFi, many outlets, lots of tables. Also, the food is great for vegans/vegetarians. Every time I come here, I make sure to grab their avocado toast, which is fresh avocado on top of a piece of toast (rye or multigrain or white). There is also veganaise (vegan mayo) on it, which is quite delicious (and won't induce a cardiac arrest). Finally, they sprinkle a bit of this yellow garnish (not sure what it is), but it is delicious. I've also tried their honey cardamom latte, which is amazing. Finally, their hummus (sprinkled with some olive oil and spices and served with tortilla chips) is extremely fresh and filling. Big fan of Lili Cafe and will most definitely be back. I love eating at Lili Cafe.. no detail is missed here!  The food is all awesome (the black bean burrito with avocado is my favorite!), great bakery treat options for dessert, a wide range of drink options (including my favorites- \"big berkey\" filtered water and locally made pressed juices) and they even have sriracha sauce which not all places have.  I seriously eat here like 2-3 times a week!  I love to sit outside when the weather is nice, but theres plenty of seating inside too.. and free wifi! Great little coffee shop, cafe. Had a great iced coffee and a tasty lemonade concoction.  Vegan food choices are very nice, as well as the vegan sweets which were very good. Staff was super and helpful. Will definitely go back to try some more things. Had lots of vegetarian and regular food choices as well. I skipped out of work and went to Lili today for a late morning coffee and a lox bagel. If you ever have a chance, you should do the same. Its a funky, cool little cafe and coffeeshop nestled in the heart of the famous/infamous polish hill neighborhood. They do really great veg/vegan sammiches, but they have real cheese, eggs and lox as well. They have an old lp turntable and i *think* they borrow vinyl from the record store upstairs so prepare your brain for some groovy often eclectic beats while you dine. The coffee here is really good. Im not sure who their supplier is, but i dont drink alot of coffee and i think its pretty good. I used to live close enough to walk to this place, and i really miss it. Toss on an old black band t, throw on some shorts and ride your bike on over to Lili cafe, grab a coffee and a snack, and if its nice take a seat out on the patio and soak up the sun. So cool. so impressed - great little cafe with a huge menu & drink list. i wanted to try everything. will definitely be back!\n\ni got the kimchi rice bowl, added a fried egg. ginger lemon tea. $9.75... cant beat that. i wish i had take a photo but it looked too good I never would have known this caf\u00e9 existed and thanks to a friend for suggesting it.  A hidden gem in Polish Hill.  We went for Sunday brunch-it is a small coffee shop which does have a back room with more seating.  For brunch it is a set menu of a few items and the regular menu offered during the week is not available.  Def. leaves you wanting to go back on a weekday as they have an extensive menu. This is very vegetarian & vegan friendly.  On Sunday we had our choice from a tofu or egg scramble which came with toast and a salad. The salad was fresh with sliced grapes and a tasty dressing.  Since I got the egg scramble sans mushroom but with cheese, onions and spinach I got the toast with a whipped chive butter.  Everything tasted amazing. As an added bonus your brunch came with tea and they have many flavors.  The d\u00e9cor inside is cute and a great place to hang out with friends and enjoy a cup or tea or coffee. Plenty of street parking. Lili is a punk rocker owned and operated vegetarian cafe. They have excellent coffee, the food is well conceived, and the space is invited and relaxing. Try the \"Mind Cure\", their signature drink that contains espresso soda, coffee, and cream. Great art on the walls and good records spinning in the corner. Lili is perfect for us \"cafe campers\" who need to get some work done while also getting our java on. There are more tables inside, though if you're lucky, you'll get one by the window and experience the sunlight too! I love cafes that offer food in addition to coffee, since it really allows you to park yourself there for an extended period of time. What separates Lili from other cafes in Pittsburgh is that their food isn't just a grilled sandwich that some college student made haphazardly using their panini maker. HELL NO. Lili food rocks!!!! I started my morning with their delicious breakfast burrito and a cappucino. What a beautiful day that was. \n\nParking is street and free (no meters). Not really difficult to find a spot, the bus does also go there. I know some people have complained about the baristas being clique-ish etc, I didn't really get that feel at all. And I have zero tattoos. They definitely have a \"regular\" crowd but I've noticed that to be the case for most of these places. They even have all these inclusive signs hung up like \"refugees are welcome\" and \"black lives matter.\"\n\nI would ideally give the place 4.5 stars but I'm feeling benevolent so we'll round up. The only reason is that the mason jars they use for free water reeked of rotten eggs (think hydrogen sulfide smell - if that means anything to you).  But really, I feel if I had asked for a glass from their collection, they would have helped me out, so it's on me for not asking - but they should rethink their dish-washing policy. We stopped here for a quick espresso before our night out. I loved the neighborhood and this place does not disappoint on charm or coffee. Atmosphere is very artsy and very hipster. There were people working on their laptops (ie. free wifi), but the space is small so I would get here early if that's what you're planning on doing. I would love to go back again and spend more time here!", "stars": 4.6}, "Regent Square": {"year": 2017, "text": "Everything is awesome as usual. We ate shish kebab and prefered medium, it was soft and delicious. You need to drink Turkish tea with any kind of Turkish desert also. Thanks for hospitality and great service. My friend and I decided to give this place a try for lunch today. We ordered the hot appetizer combination and a side of grape leaves. The grape leaves were good, but for $6 I'd say they could make them a bit bigger or give you a couple more. Same goes for the hot combo platter. $14 gets you a tiny portion of yogurt, overly greasy fried zucchini triangles (2), tiny falafel balls(2) , and little stuffed sticks of phyllo. The quality of the food was okay, but for the price you should either get more or more fresh ingredients. \nThe saving grace was the balaclava. You get four delicious pieces of it and for $6, not a bad deal. The apps are passable, but the dessert was divine. Recommended I have been here two times and both times had a great experience. I have ordered the chicken adana kabab and the mixed grill (if I remember the name correctly) and both full of flavours! I like the side of vegetable that comes with the food. For dessert, we had a cake which I believe was orange flavored: It was so amazing! One of the best cakes I had in recent memory.\nWill recommend this place to anyone who enjoys good Middle Eastern food. Came here for dinner and was very happy. The food  and service were good. I really liked the lentil soup- I ordered an entree that Was Turkish pasta with marinara sauce. Not what I expected but tasted really good.  They even comped us Turkish tea on an cold winter night. I highly recommend Really tasty kebabs . I suggest Pitt people to try their chicken kebab , chicken Adana and their fried zucchini .", "stars": 4.5}, "Shadyside": {"year": 2017, "text": "Decent choice for a quick bite if you're craving Thai in the Bakery Square area.\n\nAsiatique has a good selection of Thai classics such as Pad Thai and Tom Kha, as well as Curry dishes. I tried the Curry Laksa with rice noodles and tofu. The broth was flavorful and what I'd expect; onions and lettuce were nicely arranged in the bowl. \n\nMy shrimp spring rolls came deep-fried which wasn't clearly marked on the menu, but okay. Also, the place doesn't serve alcohol, it's BYOB. We've been coming here for awhile now and I figured it's about them to leave a review. Consistently good pizza. Always served right from the oven so it's hot and delicious. Service is also always good. Our server during our most recent visit was one that we've had before and he's excellent. Warm, friendly, and attentive. Since it was so cold outside, we didn't get gelato, but from past experiences it always wonderful. Recommended! There's always something a bit off about the Crazy Mochas. I really, truly want to like the one in Shadyside, because it's spacious and has totally nice drinks, but the atmosphere is terrible. I leave Crazy Mocha smelling like bathroom air freshener. In the winter, it's freezing. I'm currently sitting at location and half the customers are wearing their winter coats. Not comfy for studying or working. The music is hit or miss, but often is just the radio with commercials or alt rock. I think it's a totally fine place to grab coffee to go. I wish it could fix the other issues, because I think a lot more people would hang out in the space and drink more coffee/tea. I certainly would. I love Harris Grill because they have a gluten free burger and bun option, and this is a rare and wonderful thing for a Pittsburgh restaurant. It also happens to be delicious -- not at all like some of those dry, flaky gluten-free buns that suck the life out of a burger. I will keep returning.  Love, love this. Excellent food, great service. Had the Mac and Cheese with steak... cooked perfectly. Everything was absolutely delicious. My girlfriend had the Lobster Mac and Cheese and had only good things to say about it, as well. We had wings as an appetizer, which were done well, especially by Pittsburgh standards.\n\nParking was no big deal, and the only issue was a bit of a draft from the front door constantly opening and closing, but that's to be expected when it's something like 9 degrees outside. The charm of this place is definitely unique and stands out amongst an array of iffy and uninspired restaurants around the area. A three-story, re-imagined Victorian house, this place really provides the atmosphere and creativity that the people of Shadyside require. However, I would like to emphasize the distinction between appeal and delivery in regards to what we're there for (the food)! The regular menu is diverse and entertaining - I actually ENJOY the sarcastic descriptions. The wings are great and the custom bowls look heavenly. With that being said, the brunch menu is a bit frustrating. A standard price of $20.17 per meal is ambitious for what you get, especially if you can't drink. Without the mimosa, you get a coffee, dry biscuits, and breaded chicken under thick gravy with potatoes (Chicken Littles). Regardless, very solid and will definitely return after 5 pm. The other day I decided to change up my bar soap. I know that this might not be the most interesting thing to do in a day, but I really needed something different. I have had some issues with my soap. I hate the feeling of the too soft soap, it feels filmy and I don't like to feel it after I am out of the shower, on my skin. Then, the other stuff is so harsh that I feel like it dries me out so bad and then my skin gets ashy and cracks! I hate it. My one friend told me that I should go to Whole Foods and ask someone in that middle section about soaps. \n\nI took her advice and went in. First, I was happy that I actually got a parking spot right off the bat. I know, it was a big deal. Then when I walked in the lady who was working in the middle was so helpful. She talked me through some good choices of bar vs. liquid, discussed my issues, and we came up with a great solution to my shower soap issues. \n\nI left feeling good, and excited to shower with my new soap choice! I am really happy that she took my concerns to heart and did not act weirdly when I asked some intimate questions. SHe was great. \n\nAnd the bar soap worked out fantastic! I like this whole foods for a few reasons. First they always have really great fresh produce. I love to buy my kale from here, I think it is the best place in Pittsburgh to get it. I also love to buy in season fruits from here. Second, their seafood options are usually spot on (aside from Wholey's). I have had their \"butcher\" (if that is the proper term) help me select fish a few times. Third, they have a good selection of traditional medicinal teas, which happen to be my favorite teas that come in tea bags. Lastly, I love their market/prepared foods area. I come here for dinner on occasion because they have a wonderful salad bar and buffet area. I once had a salad which weighed over a pound. \n\nThe major downside to whole foods is that it is over priced, but that is the case for every whole foods. So if you have some wiggle room in your grocery budget I suggest stopping by. The store has a great variety of the items they stock. However I found the store to be very small, they don't even provide enough room for two carts to pass eachother in the produce section. Also, I called before hand to ask if they had a bulk section; I arrived and while yes, they did in fact have a bulk section it was TINY and had none of the items I needed. And the staff was less than helpful, I had to wait for two workers to finish a conversation before they even acknowledged me and the person that rang up my items moved so slow and the place was so busy all I wanted to do was leave! I had high hopes for this place because I was looking for a healthier option since moving to Pittsburgh, this was not it. It has never been very busy when we go here, so the service is always great and so are all of the menu items I have tried!  Last time we had a great lunch with some fabulous cocktails and a croque madame, it is hard to find a good one in Buffalo so it is always a treat to have one here! Came here for dinner on a Saturday a while ago. We enjoyed the chicken dish and the special vegetarian dish of the day (don't remember the exact names). They were pretty good! For dessert we shared a cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e and it was just amazing. The best I have had outside Europe. This is not French, but American French.  And if you don't like cheese, you will see the hell:( I really, really love Girasole.  We've been here many times over the years and it is always jammed, always great and always nostalgic.  The owner is so courteous and I love how he visits from table to table, having a glass of wine with the guests.  Reminds me of my grandfather's generation of Italian relatives.\n\nI wish I still lived in Pittsburgh, I would be at Girasole on a very regular basis.  Everything is good. Love, love, love! Made reservation for New Years 2016. Walked in, greeted by someone immediately, and sat. Within seconds, greeted by our waitress, whom it was super patient, kind, warm, friendly. Red Wine and Beer for drinks.\n\nStarted with the Pane di Fungo, completely all the right combinations, balance, textures, etc. Wanted to get the spinach and ricotta ravioli, but they were all out for the evening. it did not even matter, ordered the Rigatoni which was cooked absolutely perfect al dente. Also- not over sauced, just the right balance there as well. Salads came before, which were super good with the gorgonzola on top. Timing of everything was perfect too, from drinks, salads, appetizers, dinners, and asking if we wanted dessert. \n\nNext to Dish on South Side, this is my next, new favorite, romantic, intimate, quaint spot in Pittsburgh. \n\nOwner was dining at a table in the front, and wished us Happy New Year as we left. Cannot go wrong with Girasole, doing it up right for Pittsburgh diners who know and appreciate what good true food is. Great, affordable Italian food.  The food is always great, the service is pretty good, and the atmosphere is really nice.  I love it in the summer especially when they open up the small patio for dining as well.  The owner is always walking around with a glass of wine chatting it up.  Also, one of the few BYOB places in Pittsburgh! Dined at this restaurant over the holidays while visiting Pittsburgh.  It came as a recommendation from a family member and I did read current Yelp reviews before we went.  The owner is truly as abrupt as mentioned in other reviews.  Knowing this going in helped as otherwise you are truly stunned by his behavior in a service Industry. The food was good.  The service once seated was swift and obviously looking to turn tables as the line at the door was constant.  Is the food good enough to overcome the atmosphere...that is up to you! Consistently wonderful!\n\nI eat here often and never disappointed.\n\nThe Linguine Rustic (linguini w/ little neck clams) was the best I've ever eaten!  Their house salad that comes with your entre is absolutely perfect and flavorful (gorgonzola cheese and sunflower seeds are a wonderful touch!).\n\nBellissimo! I wandered into this place on a snowy Thursday night and it was absolutely amazing.  We were pretty lucky to get a table because it's a super small place.  The food was absolutely amazing - the mushroom bruscetta was out of this world and the polenta was to die for.  It's fairly unusual to find vegetarian Italian food so remarkable.  Service was great, especially for such a small space.\n\nI'd recommend Girasole for special occasions.  It's a cozy little spot. Closest to Italian restaurants in Europe that we have yet found in Pittsburgh! We liked the little cozy dining room and the decorations in the room. \n\nThe menu is diverse yet not too huge to be confusing. We tried the salad and soup that came with the entree (love that!). We liked them both. For main course, I had the Italian cheese omelet and my husband got the polenta. I liked my cheese omelet, it came well shaped and the balance of the three cheeses were good, although I would prefer less of the blue cheese. My husband enjoyed his polenta as well (in general I am not a fan of polenta's texture). \n\nWould definitely return to try pastas and other items on the menu. I love a place that serves breakfast all day.  This diner is cash only, but the food is great and portions are huge.  I had an omelet and my friend had pancakes and we were both very happy and very full! Jitters is a nice coffee place in Shadyside.  It's smaller than Coffee Tree Roasters, but the coffee is pretty good.  It takes a while to make each order, as they are made individually.  They had some nice coffee options other than black (I'm really not a coffee drinker so I'll take the fancier stuff please!).  \n\nI went here on a late Monday morning on a day off.  We also ordered bagels because I didn't have anything in the house to eat and I was too lazy to walk to Bruegger's.  I'd stay away from these types of treats; they are cheap but it's basically Giant Eagle bagels in a bag.  I took the order to go and they just toasted it there and dumped it in the bag with a small tub of cream cheese.  Nothing wrong with that, but you might as well go to Bruegger's for a real bagel and cream cheese.\n\nThey also serve ice cream and I look forward to coming back and trying that out.  I might revise my review after I try the ice cream.  I wasn't in love with Jitters the way some people were, so I don't want to rate it poorly, but I'd give it a three for indifference. The reason I like China Palace is the cheap lunch special (11-3pm). Comes with rice, hot and sour soup, and choice of meat. The restaurant has a mellow vibe and there's a bar to watch sports. Service is delightful, especially the ol lady! The full menu offers many options but overall the food is just meh. Very good pizza and variety of choices! The waitors and waitresses were very helpful and cheerful. I will be sure to come back here soon. Noodlehead . . . So good! \n\nThis has to be one of the best value restaurants in all of Pittsburgh. It's a 5 star experience. The inside decor is great with its industrial vibe. I love the inside of the restaurant. It's location in East Liberty is great as well. \n\nThis is a cash only restaurant (ATM is available inside). While this may not be the most convenient thing, it keeps prices down. \n\nPortion sizes are great and the food is great. I highly recommend the Street Noodle #1. \n\nI don't have much more to say! Service is quick. Food is delicious. Prices are inexpensive. Quantities are abundant. \n\nGo to Noodlehead. Went to order carry out and had super quick service. The food was absolutely delicious and they give you so much that I have leftovers for tomorrow! Love this place, can get busy but it's worth it. The street noodle #1 is excellent and I'm a fan of the fact that it's a BYOB place. The fact they are cash only can be a little difficult. Best.Fried.Chicken.And.Curry.Ever.\nI got medium spicy and it was perfect. Got that good spicy runny nose action. Can't wait to come back. One of the best Thai food! The bread ban is great, too. The only thing to pay attention is that they only accept cash, and the waiting is long. Best Thai noodle restaurant in Pittsburgh. The prices are great and the meals are consistently delicious This place is shady side is usually packed with people, even on weekday evenings. Prices are extremely reasonable. This place had been on our bookmarks list for a long time and the day we finally went there we were headed for a long wait. However once we got a table service was pretty fast. \nThis place has no booze and they charge 50 cents per person and allow you to bring your own booze. There's a beer store right next to this place which we didn't know about so we just spent 30min in queue waiting and getting bored. \nOnce seated we ordered pork dumplings that were served almost immediately. There were 4 in a plate and they tasted fine. We also ordered pad see ew with chicken and green curry linguine with clams. They made it really spicy as we had asked for and it was quite fun. The quantity of food they served was quite large compared to how much they charge. The see ew tasted good. The green curry linguine had a lot of curry and was pretty heavy. However I was really put off when I found little pieces of clam shell in my food. I didn't complain and create unnecessary delay as a lot of people were waiting and the servers were really busy.\n\nThis place is great value for money however you have to pay in cash(like so many other places in Pittsburgh). They have an ATM too in case you're not carrying enough with you. They also don't let you modify / customize your order except for spice level. My vegetarian friends seem to like noodle head quite a bit. As someone who loves exploring new noodle options, Noodlehead was shockingly disappointing. There are plenty of better options in Pittsburgh to choose from, so don't settle unless it's extremely convenient. \n\nAmbiance: South Highland and the surrounding East End / Shadyside area is always a great place to be, especially without side seating in the summer. The inside is a quirky rustic, which they pull off very well. In general, my biggest qualm (other than the okay food) is that they are cash only. While I do understand, it's incredibly inconvenient. In addition, they don't have a phone so you can't call ahead for Togo orders. I would agree that noodles are best fresh and you should likely enjoy them as soon as possible, it's inconvenient when you live near by and end up waiting 20 minutes in the cold for your order. \n\nFood: After hearing all the rave, I took my mom to Noodlehead when she came to visit. We enjoyed the outside seating and ordered the Street food #1 and the Pad see Yew at the waitress's recommendation. My mom ended up eating the chicken off the #1 which was good but not supposed to be the main event. \n\nI'm sure I will inevitably be drug back and hope my opinion changes. Noodlehead has the perfect location and the right food style to be my most frequented near by restaurant (I will just need more cash). I've come here literally once a month for the past 4 years because they always have the most delicious and tasty Thai flavors in every single dish on the menu. If you're considering going here, definitely don't think twice! Start with some yummy appetizers (I love the pork belly buns and spring rolls) and then get a heaping plate of noodles (my favs are the Chiang Mai curry/Kee Mao/Pad Thai). I have never been disappointed in their quality, flavor or quantity of food. Prices are super reasonable which is always wonderful. Best part is that they're BYOB and only charge 50cents per person for the \"recycling fee\". Much cheaper than other BYOB places that can charge you up to $15 to bring your own booze?? It's a very popular joint since the food/vibes are awesome so on a weekend I usually avoid arriving between 7-8 and usually only have to wait around 20-30min. They don't take reservations, and they don't have a phone and they only take cash, BUT TRUST ME its worth jumping through all of those hoops for their food!! I wasn't impressed.  Ordered spring rolls, pork dumplings and shrimp pad Thai. The rolls we're great, ingredients fresh and hot. The dumplings were bad. Lukewarm, meatball-sized with a thin veneer of dumpling. Very odd to say the least. The pad Thai was unremarkable. Small shrimp, lacked seasoning, and easily forgotten. I expected much more here since I had heard such great things. Noodlehead is great and I'm so happy to see better Asian food in Pittsburgh. \n\nThe restaurant had great decorations and we loved the vibe. We went on a Saturday night so it was packed and it took awhile for us to get seated, so try to go at times where it's not as crowded. \n\nThe food is delicious! We were starving but didn't have to worry because the service was super fast.  We had food in no time. I got the Chiang Mai curry which was soooo good. There's also a hotness scale so if you don't like spicy food, you don't have to worry! We went during restaurant week, and my boyfriend and I both enjoyed our meals.  I had heirloom tomatoes, which were fairly tasty, but maybe missing just a little flavor at times.  My boyfriend had the roasted pork loin, and it was an impressive plate!  It was cooked perfectly, and he raved about it for days.  I loved the dessert, the Spoon bar, with lots of different chocolates. I ate one of the best meals I've ever had here. I went with a group and we ordered plenty of appetizers, including the Korean fried chicken. Everything was great. I had the halibut, which was one of the best pieces of fish I've ever had. Perfectly cooked. I think how spoon really stands out is by the incredible service. The server really paid attention to food allergies and warned us in the event we wanted to share. Drinks were topped off every few minutes. Super nice host staff. If you're looking for excellent food with top notch service, this is the place for you. Have you ever eaten the best meal of your life? I have. And it was at Spoon. I eat out a lot. Too much, maybe. And I've been to a lot of restaurants that kill it with either the presentation or the taste (not both). This place does both. I'm such a huge fan! I cannot wait to go back here! The atmosphere, the food, the service, everything is just perfect. One of my favorite trucks around. I always get the Rastafarian... Jerk Chicken, Greens, Pineapple Salsa on  warm Pita. Phenominal. Their chips are a great side. Also try the Truck Pickles... Super tasty. Good and healthy wrap options....baked chicken, instead of fried.  Comes with a side of potato chips.  Buttermilk pancakes were good and nice to have the breakfast option in addition to a lunch menu.  Service was fast and friendly.  Don't be scared of the appearance as it looks like a dive bar when you enter.  Worth a visit for a quick, inexpensive lunch. Before going, I went to the website and checked the menu. Sandwiches, ribs, chicken, a real restaurant that serve BBQ products. This Saturday 1/14 night, on the Menu you have pizzas, tacos. No beef, no ribs, no chicken, no corn, no BBQ!!! I ask the waitress, she says, no we do no more ribs, but why on the site the Menu have all food you do not propose now? She don't know! Don't go there to eat BBQ. Site lie! The pizza may be back, and now we have Tacos not BBQ, but the old Bites and Brews still has the same issues as before. We went last night for dinner, browsed the menu, and after being underwhelmed left to go across the street to Harris Grill. \n\nWhat bothers me the most is the company did such a great job with the switch back to The Elbow Room from 1947, yet is failing so hard with Bites and Brews / B&B. Ordered a buff chicken and bacon pizza. Unbelievable. We are in awe. It's a great price, and you honestly can't afford not to order some right now.\n\nAlso, you're looking for a great sub, look no further than the steak ranchero. Do yourselves a favor, and call now. Very yummy! I order the large pie from here for delivery. Service is good, pizza tastes good. What more can you say about a pizza joint, it's either the best you've ever had, solid like Pizza Perfectta, or a lot of expectations were missed. Delivery was very fast and the driver was extremely kind, however the pizza was lacking. I was looking for good junk pizza but the pepperoni was burnt and it just didn't satisfy Cannot say enough great things about this place, wish I could give 100 stars!! Amazing pizza but also amazing service. I ordered a pizza but there was a mixup over the toppings and they gave me a pizza with the wrong toppings on it (allergies). So, immediately they went and made me a new pizza that was a large (I ordered a medium) and a free dessert! They also gave me the other pizza for free! I never order pizza from anywhere else in Pgh! I came here for lunch with some coworkers and we had a great time. The restaurant is gorgeous, really modern with tons of seating. We started off with the pretzel and bier cheese risotto which was INCREDIBLE. I highly recommend. I got the fried chicken sandwich as my lunch with a side of Brussels sprouts. I thought that both of these were really heavy on the oil/butter. Otherwise, they were good- but the grease was a little overwhelming and made my stomach hurt. Although my experience for lunch wasn't the greatest, I would def come back again to try some other items. So the staff is friendly, the decor and design is good, and the menu looks good but that's about it. Food was ok but came out cold after waiting for 45 minutes when they weren't busy. No one working here knows what they are doing. Everything takes forever and isn't done right. It just lacks most of what you want in a place to hang out, eat or drink. Maybe it's because it's a new place but it's no excuse, not coming backup find out. Best brussel sprouts I've ever had, perfect texture and flavor. Worth it for that alone. \n\nCrispy tofu was really disappointing though, it's not crispy at all it was completely soft on the outside, was expecting some level of crunchiness. \n\nBeers are fairly priced. Craft Beer Heaven. 100 beers on tap and really top notch selection. Came in from Las Vegas to visit family over the holidays and ended up making a couple trips here. The Burger was really good, Salmon was cooked perfectly. Brussels sprouts app was really good. Didn't try to wings but they looked very good. Front bar area is really really nice. Wish I could transplant this place back to Vegas, will be here anytime I'm back in Pittsburgh. Updating my review because I went there last week and they changed it so you have to pay $1 for fries when it previously came with your sandwich for free. Also I got literally one spoonful of soup-much less than the bowlful that I usually get. The fries were burnt and too crunchy and our waitress forgot to season them? Not worth the dollar that I am now being forced to pay. The sandwiches have also gotten smaller too, I would always get the mac attack and mac and cheese would be falling out of the sandwich but now there was barely enough? I was still hungry afterwards! It may have had to do with the fact that I went on a Monday night which is when the grilled cheeses are half off but that is no excuse for such decrease in quality. Had a philly cheese steak version of a grilled cheese. Not bad but the steak was just slightly chewy. Also had the garlic fries which had good flavor but not crispy enough. I normally do not like tomato soup but I enjoyed theres. Unique take on grilled cheese (had the fried green tomatoes sandwich--delish!) and generous craft beer options. Enjoyed the atmosphere and service was good. Holy cow are my taste buds tired! A fine establishment nestled in a wonderful neighborhood. After watching Andy Warhol eat a hamburger at the museum and purchasing 5 new aprons from Williams and Sonoma (new year, new me!), it was safe to say that I had worked up quite an appetite.\nThe lemon water that our server brought out was delicious and very flavorful. I had to watch myself, almost filled up on water.I chose a philly cheese type of grilled cheese..did I mention they have 28 different types? The philly cheese was just what the doctor ordered to combat my hunger, in addition to the succulent soup and zesty Cajun fries.\nThis place is a gem and I plan on returning to Pittsburgh all of February and sample all 28 in 28 days. Easy 5 stars plus I'll give them 5 slices of cheese making this my favorite place of all time! Thanks!!!!!!!!!!!! I am not surprised that this place has closed. Management was atrocious and often inappropriate. The prices were well above average for a below average restaurant. I think the staff was doing their best with a very limited set of tools. The managers were not as exceptional as the staff and the chefs were not incredibly consistent with the food quality. The ambiance was good. The place was not well managed though. Such an intimate atmosphere, everyone dresses pretty fancy. Me and my boyfriend came here for his big burrito free birthday dinner. It was my first time here, and I really enjoy the experience. I saw so many reviews about their bread, and it was indeed delicious. They made special butter to go with the bread, they gave us salted caramel and pumpkin butter flavor. I personally love the salted caramel one. \nWe got the calamari dish to share as an appetizer. we finished it so quickly, it was freaking delicious! For entree, my boyfriend got scallop and crab pasta, he loves it. I got their duck with gnocchi as entree, I absolutely love it! I was hesitating on getting this, because I got the duck with gnocchi in soba and I did not like it. However, the waiter told me they're made very differently. I gave it a shot and loved it! The only thing I had to say is we waited a lonnnnnng time for our meals to come, it might be because of my roasted duck. Everything else, I have zero complaint. I would definitely come back again at some special occasion. I would love to try more dishes here. Today I purchased a burnt almond torte for my husbands birthday.  WOW what a disappointment, the torte was missing the custard.  I wish I could return it for my money back. Soba is easy to review, being a simple, high quality, modern Asian restaurant. The food is excellent, building beautiful, and since they now have valet parking, the location is convenient. The menu is limited and wine list adequate. Our dinner last night consisted of a spicy chicken noodle dish, a beef noodle dish, and a shared cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e desert. Everything was outstanding, as always. Unfortunately, our server was horrible. We sat for almost 15 minutes before seeing her and she was never there when we needed her. It was the first sub-10% tip I've had to give this century. Ouch! We won't let one bad server, however, degrade our opinion of this otherwise fine restaurant. Finally, it's important to note that this is a limited menu Asian restaurant, so if you're looking for meat and potatoes this is not the place for you. This was a \"had to do\" for the vegan familia as anywhere we see a veggie protein option we will try. \n\nI like the spot for sure, it would be great for beers in the summer with the windows open. Cute and comfy and great for people watching. \n\nThe host was great, funny etc.... we had a laugh. He also turned the heaters on for us because in the winter it's a bit chilly up there. \n\nWaitress was fine, didn't know the menu at all, and certainly had no idea what a vegan was....which is fine because she asked the kitchen .\n\nI'm on prep so I had water because they had no hot tea. Jeff had a couple beers - on draft, nothing too much to offer but some Mexican beers. \n\nI had a taco salad with added tofu less the guac and cheese and dressing - lol...in the taco bowl. It was fine but for my purposes these days I could've eaten 2. \n\nIt was taco Tuesday so Jeff had 4 hard shell tacos with \"vegan beef\". It is not vegan beef, it is beans and rice blended into putty with onions. \n\nIt was pretty greasy, not ultra healthy even if you try but we are the extreme so you can definitely find something to eat there. Not a vegan hot spot, but worthy in a pinch if you're starving, or if you eat cheese the nachos looked ok...how do you kill nachos though? \n\nOh! they did have vegan cheese...and I think it was the kind that melts so you could opt for that too. I really enjoyed this coffee and tea house. They have a very unique style that I appreciated. There is a surprising amount of seating for a small independent coffee spot, however, I would imagine that it can fill up. You can also reserve a working table on their website for business meetings etc. \n\nI ordered an Italian macchiato. It was pretty good, not great. That being said, their plating is definitely something to rave about! They served my macchiato with a mini biscotti and a small glass of water. I was pretty impressed with how cute they made my order look. \n\nI will definitely be stopping by again! The coffee is good, but it's pricey and not really an atmosphere I feel comfortable in. I walked in and there were a few people on computers at their tables. I kind of got the whole \"we are all too trendy for you\" vibe. Even the girl who took my order at the cash register acted that way. I had only started looking at the menu when she persistently ask me over and over if she can get me anything, each time with more annoyance. The other girl who actually made the drinks was friendly however, and explained their charity donations. \n\nThey have a variety of interesting snacks (very pricey) but it is neat and tidy. The menu is small and to the point. The coffee is bitter (some prefer it that way) but there are plenty of ways to sweeten in up if you want to. I would return only to try the Matcha Latte, as there are more friendly coffee places around. Service is friendly but quite slow. The food, like the decor, is attractive and stylish, but except for the sushi it lacks a lot of flavor. The wonton soup is quite bland. The Kung pao chicken lacks the pizzazz found at even the average Chinese restaurant. We went to plum pan Asian cuisine for the first time. The decor and ambience was phenomenal. The staff was very friendly and prompt. Although the food was not extraordinary. We ordered their roti canai for appetizer. I have had this dish before at a Malaysian restaurant so I knew what to expect, although I was a little disappointed with what I got. It's basically curry made in peanuts sauce with chicken thighs and it's served with roti - their roti was excellent, it was very crisp and light and just melted in your mouth. The curry had a wonderful flavor to it although there was no chicken in it. \n\nFor entree we ordered chicken pad Thai which was just meh... overall good service and environment and average food. Will go there again for some sushi maybe. Great place for hot pot. The set up is very quaint. Perfect place for 2. This small homey restaurant is one of my favorites in Pittsburgh. The food is authentic. Definitely try their beef noodle soup. The bubble tea is also really great. Ordered 2x Green Milk Tea with Extra Boba with light ice and 1x Fresh Milk Green Tea with Boba. All 3 were the large size. \n\n- milk tea tastes average. Not powder like but definitely not fresh brewed tea\n- boba tastes horrible. Restaurant did not cook it long enough so it's still hard. \n\nUnenthused. I ordered delivery (no delivery fee!)  and due to the minimum I ended up ordering the \"Chicken katsu, California roll and harumaki\" lunch special and asked for gyoza instead of the harumaki. It came with miso soup and a side salad. I also ordered an addition eel roll, along with a coke. \n\nAll the food tasted good and I think the lunch special portion was pretty generous and filling for the price. If I was eating in the restaurant I probably would've ordered just that, but the eel roll was good and tasty as well. Everything looked nice, clean, and presentable. Including tax and tip, it was all under $20 and it was delivered in about half an hour. The driver was also very friendly and nice. I had no complaints and I would definitely order from here again. This is my go to spot to watch sports. It gets crowded during the football season so get there early to get a table. The 50 cent wings on Sunday, Tuesday, (i think Thursday) and Saturday are clutch. Friendly bartenders willing to put whatever sports event you want on the big screens. Frequent $0.50 wing nights. Wings delicious. Chicken fingers are a great value. And LARGE light beer pitchers for $7.50 all day every day.  College crowd after 10 on Friday/ Saturday. No better place to watch Steelers. Really delicious and authentic food. I highly recommend the mix appetizers and mix grilled. The place is very nice, clean and calm. We went on a weekday specifically to try their Lunch special, but the server strangely said \"we don't do it today, sorry\". We suspected since it was during the holiday season, they were looking for some more $, and so knowing people would come to restaurants anyway during their time off, it was a good time for them to take advantage of the situation. At that point this place lost its charm for us, and we would not return again. \n\nAbout the food, the quality is good, but they give you so little for so much. If you want Kabab, they are not the best one in town (go to Turkish Kabab House on Murray+Forbes) and we did not like the kabab. For other vegetarian appetizer/food, they are okay, but again, so little for for so much money. There are other Mediterranean restaurants with all similar food to this place, better quality and lower price, and they don't suddenly remove their lunch special during holidays. Would not return. Not my cup of tea, personally. The best part of the meal is the appetizers like the oysters, and then it all goes down hill. The pizzas are sooooo thin, it's ridiculous. The middle of the pizza is soggy, and the crust on the end is as crispy as a cracker.  I personally don't mind thin crust pizza, but when it's so thin that you can barely pick up the pizza without it falling apart, that's a problem. It is also really expensive, and I can still be a bit hungry after eating one pizza. The pizza does however taste good, which is why it gets 2 stars. I really do love this place I've been here multiple times. I love the hush puppies and the Mac and cheese is so good. I've never ordered anything I didn't like off the menu. The drink prices are unbeatable. I really enjoy how it has vintage looking booths and they use candles light. The only complaint is the service can be spotty. Sometimes it's good sometimes the waiters act like they are annoyed you are there. The burger blew my mind. It also helps that it's a traditional Old school Pittsburgh bar. It's remained unchanged and has TONS of character. Highly recommend dropping by. Great beer choices too, which is never a bad thing. This is the best Mad Mex location. \n\nThe staff is always FRIENDLY, unlike Oakland, the food is just as good (if not better), and I don't think I've ever waited more than five minutes for a table here.\n\nI've been here at least a dozen times since moving back to Pittsburgh, and it's now what comes to mind when I think \"Mad Mex\". I've had plenty of meetups with friends, nights out with my girlfriend, and even a small, informal High School reunion at this location, and have never been disappointed by the food or the service.\n\nThe only issue is the parking situation, which isn't Mad Mex's problem, but it's worth mentioning. The plaza up the street (which houses Chipotle, etc) used to allow it after all of the businesses closed, but now they have a group of security guards harassing people and threatening to tow cars all night, despite their empty lot. I ended up having to park about a half-mile away the other night. This was infuriating, considering the hundreds of empty spots right next to the restaurant. I come here often with my roommate's family. I have tried their burritos, enchiladas, tacos, and fajitas which are all good to huge portion sizes. They also usually come with rice and beans.\n\nTheir salsa is very chunky, mostly appearing as just finely diced tomatoes but has a nice level of spice. Not a huge fan of their guacamole. Needs a bit more acidity. This is far and away my favorite place for breakfast/lunch in the city. I haven't met a crepe I didn't like. The atmosphere is cozy, which also means it can fill up fast. For two people, I've never had a wait longer than 15-20 minutes. They have an awesome coffee and tea selection as well. Def a must visit for anyone! This is a tiny spot, but it's a great brunch spot.  The French toast is good but the crepes are great. It's pretty much every man for himself on arrival.  Waited at least 10 or 15 mins before waitress came over to take names.  If I hadn't shouted to her that we had been waiting, she'd have seated others who came in after us first.  They need a greeter on busy days to avoid chaos.  I ordered a crepe with fire roasted chicken and harissa.  If there was three ounces of chicken, i'd be surprised, more likely two.  I spent most of my meal thinking, well, there'll probably be some in the next bite. Don't get me wrong, the crepes are good, but prices are a bit high to be skimping.  Paid extra for avocado and literally got about a sixth of a small avocado.  Yes, Americans are spoiled on portion size, but this place needs to get a clue. The staff is always working hard, as there is usually a line out the door. I make so many adjustments to the crepes I order off the menu, and they always get it right! Along with a great  cappuccino! Plus lots of shopping around to do after! Really like this place. Really good sandwiches, great beer selection, and friendly, fun atmosphere. Great place to bring the family, especially on non-weekend nights. Gets a bit crowded and loud on the weekends. Perfect place to satisfy your craving for ramen or sushi (I liked the fuji yama rolls quite a bit). The pork donburi is also pretty good. And the staff is very nice. I was there for ramen, it has all the tools correct, but the noodle itself is not ramen or soba. though it's still good consider there is no place in pittsburgh serving real ramen I came here on Sunday night with about 8 friends to watch the Steelers game. The waitress was very friendly and helpful. The menu had many different options (tacos, sandwiches, hamburgers, salads). I ordered the Shady Burger and it was delicious! I would definitely recommend ordering it. The side of fries were pretty good, but nothing spectacular. \n\nI'd definitely come back again to try their other hamburgers! I've used them quite often for breakfast catering at work.  It's always a disappointment.  I've had empty coffee containers delivered, they're always late, they've lost orders (today's order specifically).  I have a meeting starting shortly and I won't have anything ready when our guests arrive.  This is the last order I'll be placing from Panera.  UPDATE:  Order just arrived and was wrong; only got half of what I ordered. I have been here two or three times. While the food is okay and good, I find it to be bland and dry sometimes. Given that there are a lot of other Mediterranean/Middle Eastern food close by, it is hard to come back here. But still, the food is decent. I do not like that there is no single veggie that accompanies the food. Usually in all the middle easter restaurants I have been to, when you order an entree (kabob dish, etc.) there are a few veggies for the crunchiness and as a refreshment. But in Daphne, the dish comes without anything, not even a single pickle. So, it is hard to eat, it feels very dry. Loved it! Great selection and great company. Awesome wines made locally in Maryland and shipped to PA. Owner was super friendly and made awesome recommendations for our tasting menu. Ended up with a great bottle of wine for $19 that we  split. Looking forward to coming back for live music on Fridays and to enjoy the back patio in warmer weather. We went there with a group of eleven, only two of which are vegetarian. It's safe to say the majority of us weren't exactly excited about going here. That quickly changed. Our server was warm, very attentive, knowledgeable, and patient. Some of the best service I've had in awhile and the fact that we were a large group made it all the more impressive. The food was excellent. Creative, delicious, and well prepared. I would love to give Eden four stars, but there was one rather significant problem. It was so humid in the restaurant that it became unbearable. Really, it was like a rainforest. I hope they get that worked out because it really detracted from an otherwise wonderful meal. BYOB was a plus! So glad to have The Elbow Room back at its original location on Ellsworth. I've been on a grilled cheese kick lately and was very satisfied with the cheddar and gouda. As the 3 stars says--It's an A-OK neighborhood place that has pretty good comfort food. Service was friendly, without being overwhelming and atmosphere is low-key without being low-rent. Don't forget about the Elbow Room! I have not been in a while, but the food is really excellent and the craft beer selection is impressive. \n\nWe were concerned about finding vegetarian options, but with the sandwiches, salads and sides..We were able to piece together a wonderful meal.\n\nGrist Mill is one of my favorite local breweries, and their Rye IPA was delicious.\n\nTo top things off, the service was friendly and top notch. This place is great! Relaxed neighborhood restaurant with quality service, food and drinks. Everyone can find something that they would enjoy and everything was great! Highly recommend! This ice cream . . . \n\n5 stars. This is such a high quality product priced very well. I love to eat, and I have a sweet tooth to rival any person, but two scoops of this ice cream is where I wave the white flag! It's the perfect amount and only $4! \n\nThis parlor has a very classic and enchanting vibe. It's boutique-ish. Smartly designed with bright colors to give you just the touch of whimsy you need when enjoy a cup or cone of ice cream! \n\nThe flavors . . . varied and unique! You're not sure if you think Olive Oil would make a good ice cream flavor? Don't panic. Sample it. And while you're at it, sample any of the flavors your heart desires. Millie's is committed to your satisfaction. \n\nHere's a quality ice cream, priced right, great location, amazing store design . . . \n\nWhat are you waiting for?! believe the hype, and do it right-get the freshly made waffle cone. ..how in the world did I totally skip writing this review? I have been to Millie's twice. The first time was so good, that I made sure to bring back my bf the same week! This happened in the summer but I do remember that I ordered their mint flavor as well as the best chocolate in a waffle cone. I cant remember what I ordered the second time sorry.. both flavors tasted fresh and were delicious! unique flavors, excellent owners, prime location. nothing but great things to say about this place! I've visited this sister restaurant to Stack'd maybe 2-3 times now. I have to say, while the service is a bit better, it's exactly the same menu at 1.5x the price. Went here with my brother and they literally put whole habanero peppers on his burger - you can't cut them up? In case you didn't realize, the smaller the pepper, the more dangerous it gets. Mine was basically a small chicken sandwich with marinara and provolone that ended up being $10.70 plus tip. Food and drinks were okay - their menu is BYOB - build your own burger. The burgers are actually quite big, the meat patty was tasty and overall worth the money. I was a bit disappointed by the Buffalo Chicken Wings as it was drowned in a sauce that could be barely described as Buffalo. \n\nTypical (dive-ish) sports bar - good for groups for Happy Hour. If you eat here, go with the burger.\n\nPS: Our table won the trivia game that night and was rewarded with a $25 gift card. They didn't want to let us use it though on the same night. Awkward. Came here one time, the food was good but the service was mediocre. We were the only two people in the place and there was nothing but dead air. The kid working there wasn't even talkative or friendly.", "stars": 3.8}, "Sharpsburg": {"year": 2017, "text": "Pretty space and a few solid beers on tap. Unfortunately the bartender(s) I have interacted with on my last two visits did not know anything about what was in their beers. My friend and I asked multiple times what hops were in the beer and instead of admitting they did not know, our question was side stepped and they told us what it tastes like instead. It was a little disappointing. Maybe we'll try again in a few months :/ I was super excited to visit Dancing Gnome, as I had heard great things from Sharpsburg people. The space was beautiful and all the patrons were friendly. We stopped in on a Saturday night to sample some beers and tried four different ones, mostly Pale Ales. We had a variety of beer drinkers there that night, so the reactions were mixed. Things were a little too hoppy for me, but others loved it. So it really will depend on your tastes.\n\nWith three draft sizes it made it nice to be able to try things out before committing to a whole draft. The bar area is decently large and the front space has several tables (all 6-tops, I believe). With a large crowd there when we arrived we lucked out when a group left a table and we were able to join a couple who was at the end of that table. So the communal area worked for us, but with any more people in our party we wouldn't have been able to all sit together.\n\nIt seems that they have a good variety of food trucks represented in their nightly line up. The people who were running the truck that night (it was cold outside!) were bringing in the orders to customers which seemed like a system that was working.\n\nGood job, Sharpsburg! It's a lovely venue! Oh Dancing Gnome pale ales...how i love you!!!! I don't think it is any secret that I love supporting local businesses and love frequenting local breweries! I hate playing favorites...I truly do! However, I am blown away by Dancing Gnome. The beers are so insanely good! There are often a lot of pale ales but they are all so nuanced and unique! Our friends from South Park wanted to go somewhere new in the city and we just so happened to go to Dancing Gnome on their opening evening. I was surprised at how busy they were and assumed it was because of the opening day. But every time I have gone since, the bar is full. But there 100% is good reason for this!\n\nInside, the bar is spotless and pristine looking. The workers are very knowledgeable as well. One time I was in there when a man came in with a growler that was not one of theirs. They explained to him that the lightness of the bottle (I believe it was clear) was not really beneficial to the beer and keeping the same quality. Instead of acting pretentious about it, the bartender was really nice and just gave a growler to the guy. I have no poor remarks about the place! They even have PGH Sandwich Society there, dishing out their quality in-n'-aht burgers. Just a perfect place to go, drink a perfect beer and eat a perfect burger. Simply, perfect!! Really nice atmosphere in the heart of Sharpsburg. I am not usally a fan of IPA's, but these cloudy, hazy, citrusy ones at Dancing Gnome have completely changed my mind about IPA's. They also had a stout on draft during my visit, so don't worry, it's not all IPA's! The owner and staff are all really great and do a wonderful job, especially when it gets super busy. They usually have a food truck on site too when you get hungry from all of the delicious beers. Can't wait to come back and try more beer!", "stars": 4.0}, "South Side": {"year": 2017, "text": "This is a great neighborhood joint. Non-smoking!! And delicious fries. I wanted wings but less messy so I ordered the wrap with buffalo chicken - still messy, I should have ordered the salad. Hubs had wings and they were yummy! So gross I created a yelp. The seafood was overcooked and flavorless in paella. Very bland flavors. They give you a disgusting amount of food and sides. Focus on portions and not quality or flavor or substance of food. Its like what people think is fancy and good but is actually shit food. Like for instance the stuffing in the stuffed salmon and stuffed mushrooms was the exact same thing lol. Just absolutely underwhelming in every way. ***5-star service*** wonderful atmosphere, attentive staff, great experience.\n\nSaw this place for restaurant week and wanted to try a different part of town. Made reservations for lunch, which I highly recommend-even midday, this place filled up early. Our serving staff was wonderful, attentive, and made great recommendations. Fantastic cuisine, my husband had their homemade spinach stuffed ravioli while I went right for the filet mignon. Save room for dessert-their creme brulee and flan were excellent. Definitely an upscale vibe, special occasion type place, but not overly stuffy-by the end of the meal we felt like a part of the family. We will definitely be back :) What a great restaurant in the South Side! We went for restaurant week but the entrees are on their normal menu. Everything had such a pop of flavor and was perfectly cooked. The only part of our meal that my boyfriend didn't enjoy was the dessert. \n\nThe shrimp appetizer is loaded with garlic! Definitely enough for two people. The stuffed oysters were very filling but I liked the shrimp more.\n\nFor entrees I had the chicken in cream sauce which was amazing. My boyfriend had a perfectly cooked fillet. \n\nMy lemon cake was awesome but his creme brulee was watery. They substituted it for him.\n\nAwesome service, great wine, and great food! We will be back! Sushi came on a regular plate and there was water pooled in the bottom. Sushi was average in freshness and preparation. Crab roll had little flavor and the wrap tasted terrible. Hibachi food (brought to our sushi table) was cold and flavor was bland. My son ordered noodles and they were burned in flavor and tepid at best.  The staff seemed overwhelmed and it was difficult to get things ordered.   Food came out at weird intervals and ordering green tea was a 45 minute wait?????   Nakama use to be better.....probably won't be back. I visited the station square location on Wednesday around dinner time, since they offer all you can eat shrimp for $20. Not only did I love the surroundings of this location and the city view, but my entire experience was awesome. I've also eaten at other Joe's stores, but this one had impressed me the most. First and foremost, the store is extremely clean. This is one of the major things I notice when out dining. After being seated, I ordered a pineapple pi\u00f1a colada which is served in a carved out pineapple. I highly recommend this drink!! They are fabulous! For dinner I ordered the all you can eat shrimp, steamed. I didn't have to wait long for my food but I assume they expect and have shrimp ready on those days. The staff was pleasant and the manager had made sure everything was to my liking. He actually was kind enough to show me a better way of opening the shrimp so I could spend more time eating them rather than peeling them. If you're in the area and are in the mood for some seafood, I highly recommend this spot. The prices aren't bad and it left a great impression. Went in for dinner last night. I always love the food and have been coming for years. Last night did not disappoint. Zack was our server who was great and we even got up and danced with him. It was a great night I had never noticed the dancing before but made the night even better!! We stopped in for lunch while we walked the market square to pass time on our family vacation. The waitress and manager was very attentive. The waitress didn't think the crab was cooked right so she ordered another another set without us asking. The boys grubbed up their kids crab pot. The manager came by and noticed our two boys and brought by two you sharks to entertain them (and that it did).  My dad and husband ordered Joe's classic pot, doubled. My husband is a huge seafood fan and he said It was perfect. As he gladly exclaimed 'I'm in a crab coma'!! Thank you Joe's for a great afternoon. I always seem to come here for a slice when I am going to a show at The Rex. Never at any other time have I done so. The pizza isn't that good at all yet here I am, always hungry because I don't eat before leaving the house. This place is ok for making the growling in your stomach stop temporarily. Nothing more. Nothing less. Extremely rude staff!  Was told 4 min on a large pizza. After 30 min I asked if it was close to being done and was flipped out on. Then had a partially cooked pizza pulled out and hastily chopped up and thrown on the counter. Got my refund and walked out. F this place Broken hearted. They took my all time favorite sandwich off the menu and claim it's coming back. :/ months later...  their old chicken sandwich was insanely amazing. Then they switched it up to something with way too much cranberry sauce on it and killed it.  It breaks my heart.  My review will be updated to 5 stars when you bring back the literal best thing on your menu. Good service.\nPrices in happy hour are cheap! Went to the new location on Highland Ave. Beautiful space! Along with coat/purse hooks, there are outlets and USB ports at the bar! Great selection of beer, but they also make a good cocktail and have a nice wine selection. Food is very well prepared with a selection of appetizer, small, and large plates. Every staff member I encountered was very friendly and accommodating. Been there twice and had a very good experience each time. Will certainly be back! I intended to go to Streets on Carson but it was mysteriously closed. Urban Tap seemed a good alternative. The ambiance seems cool, it has good reviews, and it's a block away.  \n\nWe ordered wings (mustard BBQ sauce), shrimp tacos, and herb fries. The wings were cooked well but dry and relatively flavorless. The sauce was too thin and tasted like it was made hastily or, worse, came from a generic bottle. The tacos weren't good either. The shells seemed poorly made and had an odd aftertaste, my friend said. The fries were great. Nice balance of crunchiness, saltiness and flavor. I don't think I would go back. Most of the food was a miss, the cocktails were good and the service was great. But that's just not enough. The location itself is cute,  the waitstaff was excellent...the food however was just OK. I ordered the Basil leaves with chicken.  There is very little spice, the chicken was bland and I was surprised at the lack of veggies. My order was to go and most of the sauce was lost in the bag,  perhaps a bowl type takeout vessel.  The food was not horrible,  the spring roll and mushroom soup were both delicious. Pretty terrible. Went to grab lunch to go, I live 10 minutes away and the pad Thai I ordered was cold and a solid mass of noodles that smelled and tasted ONLY like fish sauce. Also ordered some tofu and rice with peanut sauce that was cold and couldn't even cut the tofu. Both were thrown promptly into the garbage. The spring rolls were ok, hence the 2 star rating (the hostess was nice too). I've eaten here before and I don't remember it being so awful, but won't be ordering food here again. First time at this restaurant and I probably will not be back.  I have never been treated so rudely before in my life.  I came here yesterday with my sister for lunch.  The dining room was busy with one server who I have to assume was Sir Ben Kingsley, not only by his stunning resemblance but by his overwhelming pretentiousness that I have to think comes along with being knighted.   Anyways, the server was extremely rude as I ordered for myself instead of letting my sister go first.  I was planning on ordering for her and asking questions about the menu, as she has never had Thai food and is often very shy when it comes to these situations.  He cut me off, made some snarky remark about letting women go first, then turned his back on me and took her order.  She didn't know what she wanted because I never got the chance to ask the server questions so she just picked something.  I also never got the opportunity to tell him I wanted my dish spicey, so neither of us enjoyed our meals.  When our check was brought, he made another smart ass remark about me ordering first.  I have never been treated so rudely before by someone in the restaurant industry, and I don't plan on returning to be treated like shit again.   The soup was good tho.  If you like good soup and also some clown acting like he's better than you while serving you food, then this is the spot! Loved the food especially the curry. Wait staff great! I had pumpkin curry and fresh rolls and they were a1 I'm so addicted to this place. I get the Spicy Basil Noodles multiple times a week. They're just so good! Also, the staff is super friendly. Definitely my favorite Thai place in Pittsburgh. I would call this place a great dive. It was everything that you would want in a dive bar. Good prices, good food, good service. We took an uber from the stadium area and it was well worth the trip. It was obviously a locals bar, but they welcomed us right away. If you are looking for something other than the touristy bars, give this place a try. If you're looking for good food & cheap drinks. . .  Come here! The customer service is always excellent. I come here to relax & get a bite to eat on a Tuesday night & pre game on a Friday or Saturday before going on E Carson. One of the few places I recommend to all my friends :) Buddy's is easily the nicest beer distributor in the city, and one of the best businesses on Carson Street. I come here regularly, and recently purchased beer for my wedding here. I was thrilled with the level of service I received. The communication was great and we really appreciated the recommendations we received as to how much beer to buy for the amount of guests we had coming, etc. We were also able to return unopened cases which allowed us to purchase a little extra  just in case, without having to waste the money if we  didn't need as much as we bought. All South Side businesses should strive to be as nice as Buddy's. Piper's pub is an amazing find in Pittsburgh. The food and service is out of the world. They have a ton of options for vegetarians and vegans at such a great price. If you go, make sure to ask for Phil Better food than you would expect in a pub. Good selection of craft and imported beer, including a couple of cask ales, which are hard to find. Service also is good.  Ive enjoyed the chicken curry and the meatloaf recently. However, the menu they post on Yelp is not the current one; my waitress said it was several years old, so dont expect to find available many of the items you see in the Yelp menu. I'll start by saying I ordered the wrong thing at Piper's Pub. I ordered smoked salmon accidentally, so when the sandwich came out I simply took off the smoked salmon and ate a lovely BLT with HUGE amount of lovely crispy bacon (see pic)  Accompanying that was one of their Sunday Brunch Bloody Mary's and for dessert I ended with a few bites of their delicious Bread Pudding. D I S H. What else can you say? One of the best authentic Italian places in Pittsburgh. Owner born and raised in Sicily, variety of cocktails and beers, short simplistic menu, but you still feel like you have so many choices to choose from because EVERYTHING sounds good, looks good, and is just GOOD. \n\nLove coming here for date night due to romantic and quaint vibes at Dish. Usually avoid on the weekends, due to all of the bustle of the South Side bar scene, but absolutely one of my favorites can never go wrong, and haven't experienced a bad thing yet. \n\nDish is doing it right. A little off the beaten path in the southside is a true gem.  The place is tiny and making a reservation is definitely the way to go.  Everything we had was delicious and the service was great.   A win for sure.   \n\nWe started with the anti-pasta dish.  This contained a baked ricotta that was the star of my evening.  I could have eaten an entire plate of that alone.  So yummy!  The other items on the dish were yummy too - Giardiniera, roasted red peppers, marinated olives, caper berries and prosciutto di Parma.\n\nThis was followed by the Rigatoni alla Scamorza - Rigatoni with smoked mozzarella, prosciutto, peas, roasted and salted pistachio nuts in a cream sauce with Reggiano, fresh ground black pepper and parsley.  The portion was on the smaller side for a pasta, but it was plenty filling and I actually could have eaten less than the whole thing (which I ate because it was so good).  It was really nice combination of flavors and textures that I would definitely order again.  \n\nStuffed as I was after dinner, I couldn't skip the dessert, so I took home a piece of the lemoncello cheesecake.  A little too lemony for me, but probably the best textured cheesecake I have ever had. Dish absolutely lived up to the hype. I've heard so many great things and was excited to visit. I was concerned because I hadn't made reservations, however I was told there would be two tables set aside for walk-ins. \n\nThe ambiance: Intimate, great blend of ambient noise and quiet, seating for roughly 35 people. \n\nThe food: authentic Italian, al dente pasta preparation, great taste. I had the Spaghetti Frutti di Mare and the shrimp were jumbo size and portion quite generous. \n\nThe drinks: I had a caprihlana and it was perfect. Cocktail menu has good variety. Plenty of choices for wine as well. \n\nThe service: Excellent. Always available and attentive yet never interrupted conversation, made quality suggestions and handled substations and requests with ease. \n\nThis is a must-visit for Pittsburgh! I'm still shaking my head....  So we head down to the Southside last Wednesday (12/28) for a late lunch around 3pm.  We go in and I see that the folks behind the counter see us, but decide to just keep talking to each other with their backs turned.  Finally the young man turns around and I say \"hello\" - nothing....so I begin my order - \"two alarm turkey burger please\", he replies before I can finish \"no, that's seasonal only\", I guess I looked stunned as he repeated \"seasonal\", so I ask \"what part is seasonal, the turkey burger or the jalape\u00f1os?\" again he says \"seasonal\" so I ask \"can I get a turkey burger with jalape\u00f1os\" he just stares at me and say \"seasonal only\".  Seriously!  So i just say \"thanks for all of your help, I think we will take a pass on eating here today\".  He turns around and resumes his chat with his co-worker which I so rudely interrupted.  Wow. Stopped in for dinner for the first time after years of hearing about it. We decided on sharing appetizers.  We had the pork sliders, perogies, and mozz sticks. The mozz sticks were burnt slightly, but still okay. The pork sliders were great. Tons of pork, awesome slaw, and a crunchy pickle. The perogies were the highlight. Perfectly saut\u00e9ed and slightly crisp. Plenty of caramelized onions, and sour cream. Sub par beer selection, but overall, I'd be back. I love this little farmers market. I have been visiting for a couple years now, about once a month or so, during the spring/summer and fall months. They don't have a ton of vendors (normally) but it's still worth it to stop by and see what goodies are available. In the past, I have found some awesome homemade pastas/pasta sauces, salsas and of course- fresh produce. Parking can sometimes be tough, but you can park on East Carson Street or in the residential streets. McCormick has a nice happy hour 5-7pm, every day, including weekends. Since weekend happy hour is rare, and the drinks here are both strong and significantly discounted, 5 stars! Furthermore, the food is good too, like the mussels, edemame, and my personal favorite fish tacos. These happy hour fish tacos are comparable to elbow room's happy hour fish tacos. o.k. place to stop in for a quick one.....large selection of beers but not the best and friendly service..... the barmaid .just came up to me and with out even saying hello asked me if i wanted to know whats on tap and just handed  me a sheet of paper with the beer selection and walked away.....hummmm....the barmaid was maybe overwhelmed .....I had one and left....I was going to eat but again she wasn't very observant ..... I have been in the business for years and i would have been working that bar to the end of closing.....(if you want to make tips!!! ) but I would def. come back and give it a second try next time I come  into town in the next few weeks ......the bar looks cool inside and def. had a friendly crowed With an amazing beer selection and bar games (pool & darts) this is a gem that I need to think about frequenting more often. They kitchen menu is decent, and while I haven't eaten there in years, I do recall enjoying the wings.\n\nThey have specials each day and the waitstaff was incredible when we were there on New Years Eve (day).  Certainly a place to check out in the southside! Is there anyone out there that has done the bar crawl on e. carson? ..because ive lived in southside since 2014 and there are still bars I haven't gone to. In my defense, I had been to smoking joes in the summer.. not sure how I skipped reviewing it.\n\nI always passed by thinking it was just another dive bar with bar food. Its def not your basic spot. The food menu is cool and unique. Some things that caught my eye were kielbasa and bacon skewers, powdered pretzel bites (deep fried soft pretzels with powdered sugar), brisket & beer cheese nachos ect. They also have favorites such as a Rachel, Reuben, flatbreads, cheesesteaks and a great mix of burgers.\n\nOur go-to here is the lobster queso dip which is served with tortilla chips. It is delicious and it isn't lacking on the lobster. It tastes fresh (fresher than you'd think it'd be at a bar). You can also order the lobster queso on fries. I have also had their perogies (delish) and a burger with fries.  (bbq bacon burger)\n\nTheir draft list is huge. There is a bar, seating area and pool table. Its a cool bar with great food. Service is friendly as well. I believe kitchen is open late. We came in after 11pm on a Thursday and they were still serving. If you are looking for a friendly atmosphere with bartenders and staff that will bend over backwards, this isn't the place for you.  If you are looking for little dive bar where you can get possibly the best wings in all of Pittsburgh then look no further.\nTheir wings are smoked in house daily and served as a whole wing.  The flavor will put nearly any other wing to shame.\nThe rest of the items on the menu look good at first glance, but I would stick to the wings, didn't enjoy the sandwhich that I had.\nSynopsis: slow, not all that friendly service; fair drink prices; possibly best wings in pittsburgh This is one of my favorite lunch spots in the Southside. Great beer selection, friendly staff, and the sandwiches are always delicious. Delivery came earlier than estimated. Hot and fresh, thicker crust than I expected for NY style but still good! I have been to The Melting Pot a few times now and it has always been a great experience, ESPECIALLY my latest visit on Wednesday!! The food and drinks were amazing! \nAnd I don't know if managers actually read these but our waiter was Robert and he was thee best!!!!!! He was super polite, he went above and beyond for my friend who had a gluten allergy and was sweet. He explained everything and made sure we always had what we needed. There need to be more waiters like him because he truly made our experience so much better! My husband and i tried this for first time on a saturday night (1/12/17). Got there early (4pm) and were seated right away (no reservation). Our server dallas was wonderful the entire time! She knew it was our first time and took her time explaining things. Was expensive but you're paying for the atmosphere and experience. Would definitely be back! My husband and I ate at Melting Pot for the first time on a Saturday night for restaurant week, so we got fixed price menu.  We like fondue, which is why we decided to check it out. But the cheddar fondue was really just beer cheese, though edible. The salad (California) was good. But the whole theme of \"cooking your own food\", is really just eating a bunch of co-boiled meats (the Restaurant week menu came with teriyaki Sirloin, Jerk Filet Mignon, Sweet & Spicy Shrimp, Roasted Garlic Chicken, Butternut Squash Ravioli, veggies) with a variety of dipping sauces. I actually can't remember the last meal I ate that was so dissatisfying. J and I came here for dinner tonight to celebrate our friend's birthday. This was a first for J and I since neither of us have ever had fondue. We asked our waitress Julia a TON of questions because we were confused on how to order things, and she graciously answered everything well and provided us with great suggestions to enhance our experience. J and I both did the 4- course meal including the four cheese fondue to start, house salads with peppercorn ranch dressing, surf and turf (J), create your own meal with sesame covered tuna, Atlantic salmon, and chicken (me), and the s'mores chocolate fondue for dessert. The food was pretty good and they give you a decent portion for each. At first, we were confused about the whole \"cook your own food\" aspect, but it made the experience really interesting. The s'more fondue was everything! J and I demolished ours pretty quickly. Our bill came to a little over $100, which was decent given the quality and amount of food, Julia our waitress, and the overall experience. Are here for restaurant week so it was a great deal, $35 for dinner including dessert. I think the key is to know a bit of what you want before going in, otherwise you'll get full too fast! The salad bar is good but not amazing so I would save room for the meat. My fav was the flank steak, super juicy and flavorful. The filet mignon medallions was cooked well and very tender. My boyfriend loved the lamb chops and the leg of lamb. We skipped trying any chicken or pork, so I can't comment on those. If there are particular meats you like, you can let your server know and they will make sure it comes to you table. \n\nDrinks were good, the caipirinha was delicious - closest to a shaken margarita. And the key lime pie after was delicious! The only negative is sometimes there was significant wait before meats circulated, especially if they run out before getting to your table and you have to wait for the next batch. I'll probably be back again for lunch since it's cheaper, or for a special occasion. This is the restaurant that was chosen for our annual day after Christmas family dinner.\n\nValue:\nVery pricey, but worth it. Beware of happy hour drink specials though, not every drink is discounted, i.e. gin and tonic was $10 and price of wine was very high.\n\nAmbience:\nUpscale, very crowded, best make a reservation.\nPlace is clean but lighting is VERY dim.\n\nFood Highlights:\nSalad bar items were plentiful, fresh and delicious.\nThe lamb chops were the bomb at medium rare perfection, some of THEEE best ever and so was the Brazilian Picanha. Didn't know sirloin could get that good. Filet Mignon, meh. Leg of lamb was tasty.\n\nService:\nService was on point and awesome...until the checks arrived. Took about 1/2 hour to sort out check errors, including one that was $30 plus dollars off and NOT in our favor. Thus the four star rating.\n\nAfter eating here be prepared to be stuffed for hours if not for days!!! Amazing gyros and quick service. Everything is great about this place. It's quick and yummy. If you are out and about on the south side it's a good place to get some grub when you are drinking! And you don't have to wait long! I don't understand why businesses don't make fresh cut fries. I hate frozen French fries .. they ruin the meal. Food, not so great. It's always cold in there. And the owner is a half wit. In my opinion, it was way better when it was southside cheesesteak. Honestly, I would not feed this food to my dog. I also think the place is dirty. The cook did apoligize. Said something like it was pre cut. In any case, I truely do not think that it is real chicken. Greatest vegaterian food in the whole united states prices are great. Always full of people Went a Saturday evening, the place was empty as we walked in and no one greeted us at the door. We walked through to the dining area where one other table was eating. They were out of 5 meals on the small menu and the taste of what we got seemed like it was old and/or previously frozen. Disappointing. We used La Palapa to cater a networking event. Jes\u00fas was very great with responding to us in a timely manner. Additionally, they provided great care in setting up for our event. Most importantly, the food was delicious!! We ordered the tacos and quesadillas for 100 people. It did not disappoint. All our guests raved about it, some even asking where we catered from. \nI would really love to come into the restaurant and enjoy the food again! Honest to god the best mexican food I've ever had. The chips and salsa (pico) were well worth the extra charge - the chips were clearly freshly made as was the salsa. I ordered a chicken quesadilla and it was perfection. Guac was great. Fresh pineapple juice was so good. Rice and beans were flavorful and great size. Highly recommend! I don't understand all the rave reviews.  It's okay, but \"Best\" in Pittsburgh?  No way.  I ordered enchiladas -the chicken was dry and did not seem to have any seasoning whatsoever.  The verde could not overcome the blandness.  They were also not very hot (temperature).  When our food came out within 5 minutes, I guess it was obvious that the food had already been cooked and was reheated.  The quesadillas were dripping everywhere  (yes, yes, I know...\"authentic\") and left a lake of liquid all over the plate, not very pleasant to eat especially when they were just warm, but my niece said the flavor was good.  The server was really nice and the place is clean and cute, but our overall experience was just okay. We had take out from here. We were in the process of taking care of a lot of things so we didn't even eat it as soon as we got it back to our place. The food was still perfect even after sitting.. The bald bartender is the worst I've ever seen. Clearly he got the job because he knows someone. This place is CLASSIC. When I was a kid, there were a lot more candy stores around. It seems as if they are a dying breed and that makes the kid in me quite sad.\n\nWell this place is a child's dream.. not to mention an adult's dream as well. They have TONS of candy- everything you can think of, in bulk or individually. They have tons of chips and other snacks and they have a huge tobacco selection as well. I've never purchased tobacco here, but I can say that my boyfriend was impressed by their selection of lighters, lol. \n\nOverall- come for the candy, leave and be happy. This place is great... owner is super nice and food is legit.  Located right around the corner from The Rex... which is really convenient.  I showed the owner a rental space a few years ago and he gave me a free sandwich!  How awesome is that?  It was one of the best I have had in Pittsburgh.  I always tell people to try it out... so good.  Go support this local business! So, by \"close at 2:30\" they mean if you arrive at 1:58, they will be sweeping up and say the kitchen is already cleaned up and closed. I indicated I was a first time customer but that didn't matter. Boo! Very generous staff who work to make the meal suit your tastes. The lunch deal (noodle/rice, entree, 2 dumplings, egg, drink) is a particularly good option. Highly recommend! I originally had a very bad experience with this place and I voiced my opinion. The grub hub delivery was 50% of the problem. The manager went out of his way to call me and recreate my entire order and hand deliver it to my house (no other restaurant would ever do this). I worked in the restaurant industry for 8 years and I understand how things go. The 2nd order was so good! I am impressed honestly. Packaging can improve but the manager ensured me they were working on it! I will defiantly be ordering from them again! The best customer service I have ever had in my entire life. Amazing food with huge portion sizes at a really good price. Very clean food as well. Green Front Inn is a South Side staple, I'm pretty sure it's existed about as long as I've been alive and I'm in my 30's.\n\nIt's a very odd combination but Green Front is a dive bar mixed with an \"old people\" restaurant. The latter comment is the biggest hint about the overall food quality: most things aren't very flavorful and are usually unsalted, but everything is also incredibly cheap plus they have daily specials.\n\nGreen Front shines with their sandwiches. They're known for their fried fish, but they also make surprisingly good Reubens and steak hoagies (my Green Front meal of choice).\n\nThe servers are friendly if not a bit confused, ordering can be an inconsistent experience and I usually have to make extra sure that they have my order right before they take it to the kitchen. The staff also do not always talk to each other very nicely but in the same vein you can tell that they've worked together for years.\n\nIf you live in South Side, Green Front is worth a try to say that you got to experience the Green Front, but definitely don't go in expecting to be wowed. I feel like I'm the last city gal to have experienced Amazing Cafe...I also feel like that is a crime and I should be persecuted for it! I went yesterday with a few of my girlfriends and had one of the most flavorful salads i have ever had! I have to admit, I am always slightly weary of vegan restaurants.I love vegetables and don't exactly need cheese to have a good time. But sometimes i miss original versions while I eat their vegan counterparts. What I really look for in a vegan restaurant is simplicity and Amazing Cafe delivers that to me. I ordered the falafel salad and was blown away by the flavor!! So much dill and so many different veggies! The hummus was delectable and I thought it was very clever to turn the falafel into waffles! I would eat this salad every day and probably be a better person for it! I really loved this place! We came for brunch and everything was delicious! The cinnamon rolls were really good, salmon, waffles, omelet... you have many things to choose from the buffet, it is a really big one! Don't miss this place for a Sunday brunch and then a nice walk through Mount Washington view! :) I love the atmosphere. The majestic 100+ year old train station is impressive. We sat next to the windows with a great view of the city. Occasionally a train would go by adding to the experience.  \nThe service was prompt and courteous.  The lobster bisque and crab cakes were delicious. The calamari was great. It was cooked with peppers and a sauce that had a little spice and a little sweetness. Hard to describe. You have to try it. The best calamari I've ever had. I also loved the garlicky rolls. Great experience. My in-laws have started a tradition of going to the Grand Concourse every year for Easter. It's perfect for very large groups. The buffet style is nice and the servers at stations are always friendly. I find the buffet a bit daunting in terms of finding out what is gluten free (not all of the staff was always aware, and it's frustrating to stand there and wait for an answer). The food was nothing amazing --but we enjoy it for the atmosphere, the building itself, and the capability to hold large groups. \nI've also gone to their bar during happy hour on a weekday. Drinks were vary reasonably priced and the bar food was delicious. I love the look and feel of the bar too. This is probably my favorite Southside bar! It's great on a warm night to be able to sit in their sidewalk seating area and cozy to sit around the fireplace for brunch on a cold winter day. I've visited for brunch, happy hour, dinner, and late night drinks and all have been enjoyable. They have a big draught selection and the wine on tap has some delicious varieties. \n\nI have had the chili and the hamburger from the dinner menu, and both were delightful.\n\nThe breakfast sandwich on the brunch menu is a winner. Couple that with a mimosa and you are off to a great Saturday! We went here with a group of 20 for New Year's Eve and a few of the group had dietary restrictions, so we were a challenging group for a restaurant. They served us well and with a smile, and the food was excellent across the board. I'd love to go back with a smaller group and try it again. I went here for restaurant week and was really impressed!  There was a little bit of a mix up regarding our reservation but they were able to straighten it out and accommodate us within 10 minutes of arrival.  We sat at the round communal table around the fire which was quite warm and cozy (them almost a little too warm after awhile there!) . I sampled a couple of cocktails which were both excellent, and had the mushroom soup with the fried skate and the lemon ricotta cheesecake.  Everything was fantastic, portions were generous, and the presentation was beautiful.  All items also came out pretty quickly and the server was attentive.  I also loved the cozy ambiance and it was nice that the busier bar area was separate dining room. \n\nThe only awkward part when I first arrived is that there was this random guy standing outside a few feet in front of the front door in a winter fur trapper hat who was trying to talk to me from like 10 feet away as I was waiting outside for my friend (saying things like \"hey there!\" and I thought he was a random guy trying to hit on me or something.  When I started to walk in the restaurant I tried to just walk past him thinking he was just hanging out there when he then asks for my ID.  But he did not seem very professional and did not wear any sort of uniform or name badge so I found this rather sketchy, especially given that this was only 7pm and this is a nicer restaurant, not like a late night bar or club scene, at least not at that hour.  But besides that everything was a great experience. We went with a group of 20 people for New Years Eve and not only was the food amazing and prompt, but the staff was beyond efficient and friendly. We had several people with food allergies and they handled it flawlessly.  I had the scallops which were so fresh and sweet and not overpowered by the rest of the dish. We had basically every dish on the menu and everyone was happy. The prices are very reasonable and the wine delicious as well. Highly recommended! If you want to watch a Pens game after a Steelers playoff win, go elsewhere. There's only one t.v. and they wouldn't change it from the Packers/Giants playoff game. There's plenty of space in this bar where they could fit a second t.v. If you're going to have one, you should have it tuned to the 'Burgh teams. My boyfriend had been to Carmellas and always talked about it. We decided to spend my birthday eve here. They have a great mix of cocktails. The atmosphere and vibe are very relaxing and inviting. The cocktail menu was a tad confusing for me. I went with a basic sangria which was great. We sat at a table in the bar area and it was fun. Bartender/server was nice and made us feel welcomed. She also suggested drinks for our next visit after I had mentioned i wasn't familiar with cocktail menu \n\nOn my actual birthday we decided to stop in to celebrate restaurant week. Hostesses kindly made sure to fit us in whenever we called ahead. She mentioned a 30 minute wait but we received a text in about 15min. I preferably didn't care for their pre fixe menu and we decided on a small plates and dinner somewhere else. We were seated around the fireplace which was very different experience but cool. Perfect for january. Service was good as well as the duck tacos I had.\n\nThis may be our go to spot when we're looking for something to do, but not an actual club. Wine & Motown? yes please! Not many places on E Carson play Marvin Gaye on a Saturday night. \n\nThe crowd was a mix of all ages 25 & older. Cute bar. I tend to experience their brunch soon!! Good coffee and nice service! Mocha, white chocolate mocha, caramel latte were all good. The Monkey Mocha is special. A wing spot that charges too much and has bad quality chicken wings has no place in Pittsburgh. Taking up a good store front for another bar/restaurant in the South side. Avoid the franchise crap. After mad mex stopped making the chicken torta I found this place.  It also is close to my work. I got that and chips and salsa!  The sandwich was great but no salsa was given with the chips which really bummed me out as I'm already back to work and can't go back. If they didn't forget the salsa it would be 5/5 Hands down, the best margarita I have ever had is the seasonal winter pear.  It's like Christmas and freshly fallen snow and ice skaters and a roaring fire all wrapped up in a glass with tequila.  It's a must.  \n\nTurns out, the food is pretty darn good as well.  I had the Mexicuban - which is a Mexican take on the classic Cuban sandwich and it was delicioso!  Great bread, which makes or breaks a Cuban, awesome meats and a side of chips and their amazing roasted tomato salsa. This guac is on fiiiiire. No, really, the guac is excellent. But who the hell charges $8 for chips and salsa at a Mexican restaurant? Everyone knows that's simply a reward for rolling the dice and walking through the door. If it wasn't for the excellent service and friendly manager checking on our table, I would have questioned my decision. Oddly enough, the drinks were unique and semi-affordable. Just can't comprehend how you can charge the same for an appy as you do for a main course. Gimme a happy hour & free chips/salsa and we'll talk. You can find me at the tequila bar all day, every day. SALUD. This place has really delicious tacos and burritos at an awesome price point! The street corn is absolutely delicious, and the wide variety of taco flavors is a plus. I also have to mention that the margaritas are affordable and also pack a punch. The service was fantastic as well. I'll definitely be coming back! Tres Rios has tres reasons to go.\nDrinks.\nDrinks.\nFood.\nThis is a bar. I'll probably go back to try one of their main dishes but I often default to tacos if I'm trying a place for the first time.The presentation was nice and it came with a side of rice to justify (not really) the price of the tacos. \n$13 isn't awful for 3 tacos and a side. But they need more it needs something. No kick or no outstanding flavor. Nonetheless a decent taco.\nI had the duck ones. Can't remember exactly what it was called but I uploaded a photo.\n\nThe drinks, GOOD. They have all your latin flare drinks, a bunch of cocktails and my favorite michelada. So I was pretty pleased overall. Not to mention the staff was pretty chill. Pretty chill vibes all around. I'll be back. Ole everybody! Welcome to the new bar and Mexican eatery owned and run by the same person who owns Emilliano's restaurant and bar a few blocks down in the Southside. When my daughter and I arrived we learned that this place is primarily a young adult's hangout joint since they have a full bar as well as a small restaurant. They told us they opened the day after Thanksgiving last year.\n\nWe decided to skip the chips and salsa and try something different. My daughter opted for the chicken burrito. Since I had heard so much about the yucca fries I was thrilled to see that they come on a steak burrito so I ordered that. All burritos come with a small side salad and a Mexican style mayonnaise for dipping. Your food is served on a wooden plate.\n\nThe staff was very friendly and helpful. My daughter was admiring the artwork and steel beams set up here since she majored in art in college. She was very impressed especially with the Andy Warhol prints of different colored tacos on the wall.\n\nOn to the food. We both loved every bite of it! My steak was tender and you could taste the yucca fries inside. My daughter thoroughly enjoyed her chicken burrito. Portion sizes are not too big but enough to satisfy your hunger. They only  had two items on the dessert menu but we decided to pass on that one. \n\nIn addition to burritos, the offer salads, sandwiches which come with chips, and of course various tacos. I've heard their duck leg taco is supposed to be very good but that warrants another visit. Yes and if you don't want meat they offer beet tacos which I'm sure would be worth checking out.\n\nAnother thing i want to add is how clean the place is and was admiring the plantscape which is by the rest rooms. \n\nExpect to pay around $15.00 a person if you are not ordering drinks. Tres Rios which means \"Three Rivers\" in English centrally located in the Southside business district. There is a small pay parking lot diagonal from it if you are not able to fine street parking. Definitely worth a return trip! This was our first stop when coming into Pittsburg and we loved it!! We had a few apps and then split the pressed filet sandwich which was marvelous! We are in town for a few days so I am sure we will be back as they are opened until midnight each night! When I found out that another French restaurant had opened in Pittsburgh, I was pretty excited. Cafe du Jour still ranks as one of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh so I was indeed looking forward to the opportunity to see what this place had to offer. I came in and was immediately greeted enthusiastically by the owner of the restaurant. Telling her that it was my first time in, she immediately asked and made a number of recommendations to accommodate my preferences. This has played out every time I've come in to try something new. In general, the menu is subject to time to time depending on freshness of ingredients and what's available. I'm glad the place hasn't gotten rid of my favorite sandwich here, which is probably the Roast Pork Broccoli Rabe. There's something just so wonderful about the roast pork and how it's prepared here. Incredibly juicy, fresh, and full of flavor. Oh and did I mention that all the sandwiches here come with fresh fries that also taste great to boot? The Pressed Fillet is a great second option, but really you can't go wrong with any choice you make. They have a wide selection of appetizers and sandwiches to fit basically any taste and I also really like how they tailor menu items to different cuisines that people might like. In general, this has always been a great place to go eat. Great food, friendly and enthusiastic owners/staff, and at reasonable prices. Definitely worth a visit if you're in the area! Wonderful spot! Food was amazing, service was great, drinks were on point and the music and overall ambiance exceeded our expectations! Highly recommend it!\n\nThe arinchini was fantastic and beyond what we expected, something new! But, then...we ordered the steak filet sandwich and it was unbelievable --- was the winner that pushed us over the edge to come back again.\n\nAmazing spot! My favorite new restaurant and one of the few reasons to hit up east Carson. The pressed filet is amazing. I find myself frequently craving it. There's never a long wait and the staff is great. I will continue to request this restaurant to friends. We love coming here for a meal and it is impossible to walk past all the beautiful sweets without getting one!  They have so many vegetarian friendly options, but tables are high in demand so expect a bit of delay if you want to eat in. The food looks as good as it tastes and is fresher than most other places. I was very impressed with my first few experiences at this store.  The clerk at Customer Service took time to answer my many questions and prepare two money orders and a fax that took forever, even though he was done with his shift during our transaction. During my next visit the pharmacist went out of her way to transfer scripts from my old store and apologized profusely when her computer froze.  On a third trip a young male employee stopped and asked if he could help me find something! I found the store to be bright, cheerful and the selections, impressive (I was looking for some specialty homeopathic medicines.) Having said that, I'm new to this neighborhood, and just moved here from Greenfield.  I grew to love my old Greenfield Eagle, but I believe if some of these reviewers went there they *might* have more perspective.  This may not be Market District, but it's a very nice store. Great food and atmosphere. For the quality the prices are reasonable. Dishes are creative but have a nice comfort feel. The must try is the fresh mozzarella. Big fan of lesbos gyros. Nice, family owned establishment. Only knocked a star because they're cash only. I'd post a picture of their awesome gyros, but I'm usually too drunk and have no memory of my frequent visits. I typically just wake up next to a half-eaten gyro with dried tzatziki sauce in my hair. Keep up the good work! The food here is pretty good.  However, I agree with what other reviewers say regarding the rudeness and customer service; both in regards to the structure of the business and interactions with the service staff.  Thus far  3 people that work here have been somewhat rude.  They are cash only.  So if you dont have cash you pay $3.50 for their atm.  To me that shows the customer does not come first.  I've asked for water twice at this place.  First time, they allowed me to have a glass of tap water.  Second time, the server rudely said we only allow bottle waterr.  Okay, it's your restaurant.  I wont argue with you.  To be fair, again, the food is good.  Which is sad, because I would love to support based on food.  However I would rather go to a restaurant that wants my business.  At this restaurant, I get the vibe they  don't care if you come, or not.  They have no desire to make things convenient for their customers.  When you walk in the door, it's their way, or the highway.  Since there are a lot of great restaurants in this neighborhood, next time ill just walk across the street. This is the worst service I have ever seen. Sooooo rude. She made up rules and last calls as she went. And whined to us about her broken phone. No one cares. Interesting how she said we couldn't get a beer..yet continued to serve other patrons. We weren't drunk. And the ones they were serving were. I'm from out of town and was looking forward to this place. This place sucks. AVOID. The girls are RUDE. Visit another location. The menu is huge and the portions even bigger. The food is mediocre, I feel like they depend more on portion size rather than actual flavor. The cheesecake is good but nothing spectacular. A must go to for anyone who loves cheesecake. Their menu is extensive, so everyone should be able to find something on the menu. My favorite appetizer to share is the eggroll sampler. The avocado egg roll is amazing and creamy. The salmon firecracker roll containers perfectly cooked salmon in a crispy wrapper. It also comes with the cuban egg roll, tex mex egg roll, and plenty of dipping sauces. \n\nThe Louisiana Chicken pasta was very heavy and ginormous, so I had leftovers. The pasta dish was fine, nothing special. Sometimes I just don't even get an entree to save room for cheesecake. \n\nMy favorite cheesecake is probably the Mango Key Lime Cheesecake. The crust is made with coconut macaroons, then there is the mango cheesecake, and on top is a smooth mango mousse. The cheesecake is a light and refreshing way to end the meal. It is not too sweet or artificial tasting. I have also had the cookie dough cheesecake, which is good but not out of this world. Specifically asked for my burger to be WELL DONE and this is what I get. Disgusted! I will never order another burger again!! Love it!  Always taste so good.  Please put more in the Pittsburgh area preferably Greensburg :) Stopped by there for a few drinks before work dinner; Tuesdays are $2.50 pnts, which was a great deal! We went back on Wednesday and the prices were a lot higher. So if it was a Tuesday, I'd definitely go. Any other day? Probably not. \n\nWe were there early and there weren't that many people there, but we went back later (yes, we hot the bar twice in one night!) and there were a LOT more people there. The bartender on Tuesday was great. He was friendly and kept us refilled. Most of the stars are for Tuesday and the great bartender, although the food was good!\n\nWednesday we went back for dinner; no beer specials, but instead the special was whiskey and wine; I like wine okay but wasn't impressed with what was on special, and I don't like whiskey. The food was pretty good. I had fried cheese curds, which didn't squeak to my disappointment. I though cheese curds were the squeaky ones? Maybe they fried the squeak out of them? My friend had corned beef and cabbage egg rolls . Both were good! The waitress was just meh.  She wasn't  as helpful or as quick to keep us refilled as the bartender the night before.\n\nThey had a fire in the fire pit outside which felt fantastic to this cold Texan. I was not ready for the cold up there!!\n\nI would go here here again, and probably will be back next year when the next work meeting happens! Although only if it's a Tuesday! The Onion Soup and Fish and Chips were perhaps the best I've ever had.  Perfect atmosphere, great food. Sweet Jesus. This place, at least on the weekend, is more of a daycare than a breakfast joint. Babies screeching, incredibly loud music, crashing in the kitchen, and you've got yourself an impressive aural assault, baby! \n\nThe waiting area is about the size of my coffee table, so you have to awkwardly jam yourself into a corner while waiting for a table (despite putting yourself on the waitlist prior to arrival). There is zero ambiance and the tables are packed together so tightly, nearby toddlers can furtively wipe their boogers on you. The horror.\n\nTwo stars instead of one because they have a decent tea selection, our server was very nice, and the food wasn't bad. It definitely wasn't great either though. Should have gone to the Chipotle down the road instead. Went here last week on the Friday before New Year's. A wait for 3 people was only for a few minutes, so we lucked out there. Probably because most people's work places didn't decide to have New Year's Day observed on Friday instead of Monday like mine did. But it worked out!\n\nNone of us had ever been in before, and I suggested it once I remembered that it being a Friday, The Yard would not actually be serving brunch and I had to think of an alternative. I don't know how I heard of it, but the name sticks out! And friends were met.\n\nService was prompt and courteous. Coffee was really good, which is kind of rare for a breakfast place in my view. I also liked the tiny coffee cups that they served it in-it allowed me to actually finish a cup for once before they came around to refill it, (thus ending the constant adjusting of cream and sugar ratio to each cup.)\n\nI got the Breakfast Magic specialty waffle...which I was really confused about when I ordered. I thought it was just an egg breakfast? (I dunno. I read the menu really, really wrong.) and was confused but not upset when I got waffles WITH an egg on top. It also explains the befuddled look I got from our server when I asked if it came with toast or anything. (No. The answer is no, waffles do not generally also come with toast, Kate, you carbivore.)\n\nIt was really good! A plain waffle topped with bacon,cheddar cheese and green onion with an egg (cooked your way) on top. Really yummy, but I didn't see any of the toppings cooked into the waffle as advertised, just on top. Shrug. It was good and filling. The aforementioned toast was unnecessary.\n\nSolid 4 stars. I'll be back Oh. My. God. This place is breakfast heaven! I'm from out of town &found it on yelp... definitely met my expectations! We had the chicken & waffles (with a side of delicious gravy) as well as the Benny which is a twist on the classic eggs Benedict! If I could give it 10 stars, I would! Very cold Sunday morning visit today, both outside and inside restaurant. We were a party of 4 and arrived early in the day. We waited just a minute or two before being seated. We sat at a 4 top by the hostess stand. Horrible spot on a cold day. There are doors that are locked by the hostess stand, but there was so much cold air pouring in between the locked doors and under the doors. Are four of us were frozen and left our coats on the entire time in the restaurant. \nI have been wanting to try one of the locations for quite some time and finally got my opportunity this morning. My wife liked her breakfast combo that she had. My son and I each had the chicken and waffles. We both liked the chicken a lot but the waffles not so much.  My son only would eat one bite of his. My daughter ordered the kids waffles with strawberries and Nutella. She enjoyed her sausage patty but absolutely hated her waffle. She ended up just eating her strawberries and Nutella. Then we were charged with a drink that we never ordered. I only noticed it after paying the bill. When I noticed we had paid and there was a big line of people eyeing our table. It wasn't worth the time to ask for my $2 back.  I'm sad it wasn't all that I had hoped it would be. Came to this place while visiting with my friends from Miami for the fins steelers game. This was by far my favorite part of my trip! Food was amazing, I had the chicken and waffles with a side of gravy( a must) ... fantastic! I was excited to return here and we had such a good dinner. Watching dinner being prepared on the large grill and picking what you want makes this a fun place. Don't forget to hit the gong to thank them! I opted for 2 bowls and also tried some different ingredients. I just really like the large options that are available. The winning combination of D.I.Y. and dinner and a show, BD's is a totally glorious experience.\nIf you're doing a bowl (or multiple bowls), you're in complete control; personally selecting each perfect broccoli floret, each plump scallop, every drop of whatever sauce tickles your fancy. However much of whatever you desire, provided it fits in your bowl.\nAfter this satisfying process, you present the fruits, vegetables, and meats of your labor to the grill cook... And the show begins.\nUsing utensils that are part tongs, part knife, they prepare your meal with the flair of a true maestro.\nYou end up with your very own personalized masterpiece. It's beautiful, and it's okay to cry tears of joy as you eat it.\n\nAlso worth noting: the cocktails are worth considering, the beer list is usually quite decent, and if you're adding soup and salad bar, keep your eyes peeled for the Creme Andaluz... It is savory and sooo creamy. I was disappointed with my first trip to BD's. I do not have one near where I live, so I went to this one when I recently was out of town for a Steelers game. I have heard many people rave about BD's so I was excited to make my first trip there. The service was good, the cooks were friendly, the restaurant was clean, the prices were descent. My big problem was the quality of the food. The shrimp they had were literally about the size of a penny. The steak they had, at least after it was cooked, reminded me of steak ums. The chicken was decent, the had imitation crab. The vegetables and sauce were normal, nothing to write home about. I wouldn't even mind paying more if the quality of the protein was better, basically it's a glorified create your own stir fry joint. I wouldn't go back, which is sad, because this place does have potential. This place is a hit or miss with the food. I've stopped coming here because you just never really know if it will be amazing or terrible. I've eaten here a few times and I want to like it more than I do. I like the patio seating which is nice but I think that is all I really like. They even have a special patio area where you can bring your dog and eat! Service, prices and overall experience is adequate but not spectacular. The food is average but I've never had a fabulous meal here. I'd come here again if someone wanted to because you can get a decent meal but I would likely not choose it on my own. We had a great time. Although it was a big menu, it offered a fantastic selection of food and beer for whatever mood you were in. The bar staff was friendly and helpful and we enjoyed ourselves for a quick bite and brew. A definite fun spot and we loved the three legged dog t-shirts! Disclaimer: I don't drink hot beverages other than hot chocolate! :)\n\nThis local coffee shop has been a great place for meetings and they feature local art! With free Wi-Fi and a decent amount of table space it is my go-to space when I need to schedule a coffee meeting in the Southside. If you are like me, the hot chocolate is a great option. \n\nThe menu includes the usual hot beverages, smoothies, and now some food items. They have a case that includes baked goods and some pre-made food choices. I haven't tried the hot foods, but the options for breakfast often look yummy!\n\nThe staff is always friendly and the place is clean. I suggest checking it out! Got the 20oz drop of the day. Really nicely blended medium roast. Would definitely come here again. Thumbs down to Milkshake factory being closed for last day due to the  holidays but thumbs up for this great alternative! My daughter and I decided to check in here for a coffee and a latte. My daughter decided to go with what they call a sweetheart frozen latte with white chocolate and raspberry.  I opted for the brew of the day which was a Brazilian roast.\n\nThe place was packed with people and along the walls were various artwork for sale. They have an upstairs area to sit but since we were under time constraints we decided to stay downstairs and enjoy our drinks at a long bar stool. Sandwiches and a couple of sweets are also available for purchase as well as smoothies, hot chocolate, and juices.\n\nMy daughter really enjoyed her frozen latte. My coffee was a good medium blend. Was a bit piping hot that I burned my tongue a little. Still you get a lot of bang for your buck. Coffee was very good. Free WiFi is available here for the many I saw working on their laptops. They have a assortment of expressos to choose from.  Makes a great place to unwind while you're in the heart of Southside's business district. Stopped in for lunch on a Saturday, the staff is super friendly, helpful and accommodating. \nThe atmosphere is cool but not that niche style/ hole in the wall BBQ joint that smells like smoke that you'd expect. \n\nThe major positives aside from the great staff here are the drink menu, beer selection, and the nibblers; They compliment a good drink if you stop in to watch a game (the place is equipped to accommodate your game watching needs) \n\nBut that brings me to my meal. The buffalo bleu. It was a good bun, and a tasty sauce especially if you like bleu cheese. The jalapenos were fresh which made it really tasty and there was a really nice texture difference with the crunch from the onion on top. I evidently made a mistake by substituting the beef burger for the Chicken. I assumed chicken from a bbq joint would be pretty good. I was wrong. It was thin and underwhelming. The burger would've been great had I not substituted but i effed up and substituted the product made to work in the first place. \n\nDefinitely going to go back. In talking to one of the owners ,who runs the taqueria next door, the chicken is not the same chicken they serve in there BBQ/smoked dishes, which is the reason I tacked on a star. Ownership is clearly committed to serving the best product gotta love that. I usually don't go to bigger restaurants but this place was very calm on a Wednesday lunch hour. I ordered sauerkraut balls with a side of sweet honey mustard, which were piping hot, crunchy and yes, super tangy.\nThe lunch buffet for $11.99 was offered numerous times so I went for it. Schnitzel, soup, salad, brats sauerkraut, mash, and rolls and a few other dishes were the selection. First time I went up, hot and fresh. Second time I went up, food was cold thus the four stars.\nI got a pecan pie ala mode which was thin, smashed and cold and $6.99! The other reason for four stars.\nI will be back but will avoid the buffet and overrated and overpriced pie. The food is always great as is the service. We go when the weather is nice enough to sit outside. Open until 11pm but close their kitchen at 9pm. From out of town and a local recommended it. Disappointed. I have really really enjoyed every time I've been here! I've only come for college night, which is Thursdays at 9pm until 11pm with a live band that plays cover songs. I've been here once for dinner, and was very very impressed. Their bier cheese and pretzels are to diiiiiie for and their half rack of baby ribs was amazing! We were first standing in line at the Cheesecake Factory. It was a 45 minute wait and we were trying to catch a movie.  So I Yelped what was close by and this place popped up.  I wait listed it.  We were there in 5 minutes. There were lots of people waiting and I walked up to the podium to check in. They told the person in front of me the wait was 30 minutes.  I gave my name and they sat us immediately. Love that feature!!!  My 16 year old had the roast beef Au jus.  She thought it was tasty. She said she would order it again. I had the bratwurst of the month which was a smokey bacon flavor.  Came with sauerkraut and fries. I enjoyed it along with their own brewed beer.  I like Blue Moon and Shock Top and they gave me one of their brews that tasted similar. We were in and out and able to get to our movie on time. When I used to drink beer, this would be the place to get a good one. Make sure you load up on carbs before you go to the place. Otherwise, you may get extremely drink from the liters and pints. The view from the restaurant is really spectacular. The river and the crowd are unbeatable. Great pretzels and beer cheese! I am not a huge fan of their other food, but the soft pretzels definitely make up for where the menu may be lacking. Hofbrauhaus also has a great atmosphere and is tons of fun. I definitely recommend to anyone in the Southside Works area! I was traveling for work this week and staying at a nearby hotel.  I wanted something different than \"national chain\" restaurant food but close by and the hotel front desk recommended Hofbrauhaus.  It proved to be an excellent recommendation.\n\nThe service at the resturant was quick and efficient from the front door all the way through paying the bill.  The German food that we had was delicious.  I had the house brewed Hefe Weizen and Sauerbraten and Apple Streudel for dessert.  I'd highly recommend this establishment. If I could give zero stars, I would. The sushi was cut too thick and smelled like bleach. I had to get up three times to get the attention of server. The bar could not make a drink to save their life and sent the wrong bottle of wine. They overcharged us and fought us about the bill. I will never be back and suggest you don't waste your time. This is a great place! I'll start with the con. It was a little bit of a wait for our food (30 min, and it's not crowded at all) but that's it.   It wasn't too crowded, so 30 minutes turned into 15. My bowl was massive for the Nabe Yaki Udon, and there was a ton of soup. Actually, everyone at the table got a salad and miso soup for an appetizer. Nice! Lots of food, decent prices (mine was $15, not too bad for a huge bowl) and everyone probably paid less than $20 for their meals. I'm probably gonna come here for my birthday, quite excited! This is a decent place, and they also seated us in less time than we thought. Lighting is nice, romantic and great for a date, but still fine with groups. Not really a kids' place unless they're older. But great atmosphere! I haven't tried the sushi, so I need to do that. Great place on a Saturday night, plus there's a bar. During the Legendary Haunt Tour back in November 2016, this was our dinner place for the evening. The group was about 200 people and this place was suppose to have enough room for us all. I thought maybe our tour organizer purchased the whole restaurant because it looked small outside. \n\nNope. The restaurant was open to everyone and our section was upstairs in a few small rooms. First off, we are haunters with our spooky look going on. Other customers were staying at us because we looked like Halloween in November in the city. Second, the set was a huge failure. Not enough food, not enough room for 200 people, and the food was horrible. \n\nTo be honest, I thought Taco Bell tasted better than what was served to us here that night. The taco fillings like chicken and beef was too spicy, greasy, and not well seasoned. It had some season that was extremely strong. The enchiladas were too mushy that they were hard to pick up without falling apart. While in line for the buffet set up for us, I had to wait a while for more food. Not very selective in the food choices offered to us either. \n\nThen we were given 2 drink tickets for the bar. I tried to order a cocktail, but was denied because it was only good for beer. However, other people were able to get cocktails with their drink tickets. I was upset. I just got 1 beer and gave my other ticket away. Then seating was a huge issue. It's very difficult to eat tacos, enchiladas, and nacho dip standing up holding a glass of beer and plate. All seats were taken in the small place. Then since people were waiting for seats, people felt rushed to finish their meal so they can offer their seat to someone else. I wanted to enjoy my meal and have conversations with other people. That is what is suppose to happened during the tour. \n\nOverall, I completely disliked this restaurant. Not because of the tour experience, but because the food was horrible and the staff wasn't that nice either. Some staff members had an attitude towards us. No bueno. I've been to hundreds of concerts across the country and I'm attempting to write a review of every venue to assist my concert going troubadours.\n\nElizabeth Cook - August 7, 2016\n\nOne of my favorite venues in Pittsburgh. It reminds me a lot of the Bluebird in Nashville - very intimate, urban lounge setting, great sound. I have intimacy issues, so sometimes a little too close to the artist. \n\nThe staff has always been friendly and the prices seem about right.\n\nMy only grip is they don't seem to use social media correctly to promote shows. I often don't hear about shows until they are sold out or passed. Thai chili chicken tacos are amazing, a 10 out of 10.  Breading on the chicken was amazing and the sauce is to die for, plus the portion size/price is amazing.\n\nFries were good and I opted to go traditional with malt vinegar.\n\nBoxty tots are amazing.\n\nDeep fried shrimp were good but the beading did fall off a bit.  Everyone else loved their food.  Cook and register guy were great and nice as could be but food does take a bit.  Still, definitely worth it and we will be back! run by cool people, they provide some perfectly fried delights. now with doughnuts!!\n\nWhen it comes to fried food and ignoring your diet this shop fries it to perfection and to order. My go to is the Thai chicken boxy tots, if you like sweet and spicy and flavor then my god this box is perfect! Their pies are swell and their shrimp and chips, man those shrimp are the bountiesT juiciest little buggers.\nI swing by here often and never once had it failed me when it came to fried food delights. Almost all the food I've had from The Pub Chip Shop has been taken home for dinner, but that doesn't keep it from being delicious just the same. I love to have the Oysters and Chips (pic) and for breakfast it's always a treat when I get to have their Sausage Roll (pic) with HP Sauce (which I'm hooked on). My husband loves to get the The Ripper Box whenever we are getting their food to bring home. Sometimes I just get the Steak & Ale pie, which is also very good. The guys in the shop area always cool and treat us like we're in the club - no snobby attitudes. It's just a cool place with great food. Great food, excellent service! Mozzarella appetizer was incredible. Would definitely recommend! Found this place by accident. We both built our own frittatas that came with toast and home fries. They were excellent. We will be back I found out about this place from my Uber Driver.    I had a few cocktails down the street that had great food but ate there a couple of days ago.  I needed a change of pace.\n\nI walked down to Doce Taqueria.   A small restaurant full of flavor and character.  Their menu is on a chalkboard above where the prepare the food.  They have maybe 8-10 seats in a counter type setting.\n\nThe place is awesome.   I watched many patrons come in for to-go orders.  Since I was new, I requested the server to choose my selection of 3 tacos (corn tortilla).\n\nI had a beef, pork, and chicken taco.   The beef and chicken were really good but my favorite was the carnitas (pork).   Not only did the port have great flavor, they put all the accouterments that one could want.  All the ingredients were fresh and the meal had great flavor.\n\nSince they do not serve alcohol - I enjoyed a Mexican soda (Grapefruit) which tasted like a Sprite.\n\nThe meal was so good - I order 3 more \"to-go\".  I explained to the server I would need to be wearing my sweat pants for the next 3 tacos ;-).   I really enjoyed the meal and would recommend you stop by and give this a try. This place is adorable!  Super small and cute inside, excellent service, and delicious tacos.  I love that they have daily specials and a frequent taco card to earn free food!  I will 100% be back and I can't wait to bring my friends! God's gift to mankind.  Best little Mexican place in SS and possibly planet earth.  They also have very attractive people that work there as if it couldn't get any better. So in my second and third visits I decided to update my review from yes to *insert expletive here* yes!\n\nThe place is consistently good. The special changes and the quality remains the same. Ownership clearly gives a care about the satisfaction of their customers. This place doesn't over-brand and then push the price based on it being a trendy cool spot. They should change the name to hey man, here's a taco, I hope you enjoy it and also your day. \n\nGranted that wouldn't fit on the sign and is a mouth-full(pun intended) so Doce Taqueria is fine. A place like this deserves the traffic simply because it 1. Is simple and priced accordingly\n2. It is quick and convenient and tasty(quality meat). 3. It's a pleasure just visiting when the staff and ownership are chill chill cool beans.\n\nBottom line go to Doce if you're hungry and want a taco man.Go if you're not hungry and want a taco. Just go! All I can say is this is my favorite spot for taco's. I can sit here and rave about it, but you seriously need to go try it out for yourself. The staff is so cool and friendly, you cant beat these prices and it is super clean. The food is always fresh and the cook will always answer any questions with an upbeat attitude. I cant say enough great things about this place. The pork taco is by far my favorite, but they offer many other options including chicken, beef and a veggie taco as well as nachos, beans, and now chili. Been here twice already - once before it officially opened. Seriously so good. Walt and his wife are awesome. The fudge is out of this world. The ice cream flavors are unreal - so different and unique. The prices are ridiculous. We bought a few pieces of chocolate and a cup of ice cream and it was only $6. Wayyyyy better quality and taste than the Milkshake Factory up the street. Holy smokes this is the trendiest little milkshake shop, with some great roots here in Pittsburgh. I hope it gets all the success because their milkshakes are out of this world decadent. My sister and I were out searching for something sweet and we stumbled upon this gem. Their shakes are unique, named after local businesses and very complex with many great toppings. Did I mention they were also massive? Like massive massive. No I still won't share. 8)\n\nIt's a super atmospheric place to hang out and I love the decor. Also so friendly!! Expect me to come by frequently! One of my family's favorite place! This is a family style restaurant, so get ready to debate on what dishes will be ordered. The serving sizes are true to the descriptions.  I've been going for years, including during my pre-gluten free days. We LOVE the garlic bread and margherita pizza,. Unfortunately, the percentage of gluten free dishes on the menu is decreased, however, they do have a gluten free menu. I recommend the chicken saltimbocca. One tip- we never order sides (usually just pizza, entres, and salads) because there is so much to fill up on in terms of dishes. The atmosphere is always fun and they are great with large groups of people. My sister had her wedding rehearsal dinner there and everyone was happy. This is a great place to enjoy\uff01  fun place to enjoy and have a great dinner with your loved ones! This place is trying to be high class smack in the middle of a collegiate bar strip, but that's not inherently a bad thing. The interior is small, sleek, and stylish. I dig that there's pieces from local artists covering most of the walls.\n\nThe theme is Asian fusion. Food is on the pricey side but manageable if you stay away from the entrees. The sushi and appetizer menus both have satisfying selections. M&J's real stars are the sushi (the portion sizes of which are not skimpy by any means) and cocktails. M&J's special rolls are some of the best sushi we've ever had.\n\nWe, however, did go with entrees and that's kind of where I feel M&J's falls short. I got scallops featuring Thai chili sauce, cilantro rice, and spinach; my husband got braised ribs featuring wasabi mash and carrots/beans.\n\nMy scallops (which were huge) were wonderful, as was the chili sauce. The cilantro rice was okay. Didn't care much for the spinach, just no flavor of its own; you had to mix it with everything else to help it. The texture of my husband's braised ribs was good but I felt they were under-seasoned. He loved the mashed potatoes though, I didn't even get to try them!\n\nOverall, our main entrees were fine, passable, and it was obvious a lot of work was put into the preparation and plating. But when we're talking $26+ for an entree, I usually expect less nitpicks with the quality.\n\nBut that's exactly what they are: nitpicks. I can get behind what M&J's is trying to do and it was crystal clear the staff wants you to have an amazing experience. I look forward to visiting in the future. Went here for lunch on 1/18/2017 with a group of 5 co-workers. Everything was fresh, delicious, and hand crafted, not freezer food. The plating was also very nice, as was our waiter. I actually don't use Ketchup on my fries, and thus didn't ask for it. The owner/chef seemed to really get pissed about the waiter not bringing it to me, even though I didn't need it. I witnessed the chef reprimand our waiter, and wasn't too keen on seeing that. The waiter was super polite, always saying \"pardon my reach\", and \"thank you\". Another set of co-workers went today and had an equally awesome experience.\n\nSteamed Pork Bun things - Killer, get that shit\nBistro Burger - Fresh, quality ingredients, get that shit\nChick Curry - Get that shit\nEgg Roll - Get that shit\n\nAll in all, get all the food While on a walk about on the South side I ventured into the Milk Shake Factory.   I really was not in the mood for a milkshake but decided to check it out.\n\nI was surprised that they offer much more than milkshakes.   While the shakes looked good, I passed for the time being.    I did order some trail mix bark and chocolate covered peanut butter Ritz crackers.\n\nThe trail mix bark was awesome.   A thick piece of home made dark chocolate with a mixture of dried nuts, fruit, etc...   It was the perfect desert.\n\nThe chocolate covered peanut butter Ritz cracker was probably the best.   It was a perfect ration of the milk chocolate - buttery Ritz - fresh / smooth peanut butter.  The center had an airy quality provided by the cracker.\n\nIt was phenomenal.  I am glad I only ordered one of each. Passed this place a bunch of times but never ventured in. Glad we finally decided to stop in. Great service, I believe the bartender waited on us, very friendly and timely.  We both got The Thick Burger. She got the fries and I got the beer battered onion rings. The burger was fantastic.  Real beef patty, not frozen, BBQ sauce, cheddar cheese, bacon, topped with onion rings on a brioche bun. Hot and juicy,great flavor. Both the fries and onion rings were great,fries were seasoned. Will definitely be back. Pretty standard hibachi fare. However they're consistent, good quality and offer takeout (don't ask me why so many restaurants in the city do not). I usually get the shrimp hibachi meal which comes with about 10-12 medium size shrimp, hibachi rice (small portion), grilled mushrooms and mixed vegetables. It's enjoyable but won't blow you away. Great place for sushi on the Southside. We got a handful of various vegetable rolls, a tempura roll, a salmon skin roll and a First Date roll. It was all pretty good. As usual for Pittsburgh, the rice wasn't vinegared like its supposed to be. But besides that, everything tasted great. Wasn't too expensive, either.\n\nThe ambiance is cool. Its all like neon seats and its well lighted. The servers were nice. The sushi chefs were very pleasant and were all working quite diligently in the middle of the room where the sushi area is.\n\nWe also got a a bubble tea and mochi ice cream. The bubble tea wasn't tapioca balls, but little tiny balls with juice in them. Good, but I was expecting the tapioca.\n\nGreat place, I will be back. Stopped here for a quick espresso and a break from the snow! The atmosphere is incredible here, so unique and fun! We got espresso shots which were great and the barista really knew a lot about the coffee and the brand. Would love to come back here in the morning!! Stopped in for an Irish coffee. 5.50 is a great price, and it was made with Jameson. Fast service, tasty drink.\nReview edited. Bathroom had shit all over the seat. Dropped from 4 to 1 stars. Great espresso, wonderful service and fun quirky atmosphere. Definitely a place to try for a quick coffee! I've been to hundreds of concerts across the country and I'm attempting to write a review of every venue to assist my concert going troubadours.\n\nChris Knight - August 11, 2016\n\nI'm really torn between 3 and 4 stars.\n\nOn one hand, excellent staff; we didn't want for anything. At one point, we asked for water and received free bottles. The three of us did run up a $170 bar tab in 2 hours, so this was a nice courtesy - shows the staff is paying attention to their customer needs. \n\nThe bathrooms are immaculate and the sound was pristine (acoustic show).\n \nBut, I'm used to rowdy venues where beer bottles are whizzing past my head and the concertgoers are moshing. Hard Rock as a concert venue was a little too corporate, too sterile (a little too expensive) and I'm afraid I might lose some street cred writing so favorably about it. \n\nThe one issue I have is the venue must have sat dinner patrons up to a certain time because there were a lot of kids and older people wandering around, in and out of the bathrooms and down the ramps (generally people who wouldn't attend a Chris Knight show). It felt like going to my nephews' birthday party where alcohol is served, but you can't get drunk in front of the kids and grandparents. Overall, it restrained my rowdiness a little. Had a really great experience here over the weekend.\n\nA group of about 8 of us came for Happy Hour. Our server (sorry I forget her name!) was super nice and let us keep adding to our table and helped getting us more chairs.\n\nHappy hour was half price most of the appetizers. Also drafts were only 3.75 which is amazing for an IPA beer.\n\nI ended up ordering something that was not even on the menu, and the server did not bat a lash. It came out just how I wanted.\n\nIt is not often you can have multiple drinks, and a full meal for $20. I will be sure to frequent here more often for happy hour! Grabbed a few drinks here with a date recently. I arrived early so I hit the bar for a few to loosen up. The bartender Sarah immediately made me feel at ease and comfortable and my date went great. Would recommend to a friend and will be back! I looooove coming in to get the hummus plate. Caitlin is my favorite bartender. Always greets me with a smile and makes me a special drink. Shows me pics of her cute dog. A godsend, truly. Station square bar Louie is amazing. All the staff are super friendly. Our bartender Caitlin took awesome care of us. Food was on point and drinks came quick. I'd recommend this spot over most other Southside bar grub hubs Employees are unprofessional and rude. They treat the bar like it's their own private party and I heard them repeatedly insult patrons behind their backs. Not the best layout if you want to dance due to empty tables being scattered all over the bar. Obviously this place is mismanaged and I will not be returning for quite some time. Food was basic and they charge you for condiments. Our server had a large attitude problem our whole time there(during a steeler game). However the bartenders are very nice and can make a good drink though. This place is a gem! They immediately bring chips with your drinks, yum! We always get California burritos- choripollo (chorizo chicken). It's probably big enough for my husband and I each get our own so we can take some home. We loooove chorizo! Staff is always friendly and we've never had any issues. I love emilianos. They offer great food and fast processional service. I really like chips and salsa. And their queso is good to! I always go for the arroz con pollo dish. I've never been dissatisfied when I go in. They also offer takeout and usually have your food ready in 10 minutes. Take out comes with chips and salsa to! I have noticed however when I order take out the food has consistently been sub par to when I eat in  by a conderiable amount. Idk what it is but the chicken just has so much less flavor then the delicious dish I get when I eat in. I have been here so many times and NEVER have had a bad experience, one of my favorite places in Pittsburgh! Drinks, food, and staff are always on point, and wait for food is never that long even when it's busy. Recently we went and our server Tommie was awesome, she took great care of us. Love love love this place! The food is amazing! Prices are fair and if u get a chance, make sure you get a seat in the bar area. Bollo is the best bartender/waiter. Love this place! Soooo friendly! Cheap, good, comfort food. Favorite of mine. Have to pay in cash but they have an ATM. It took me a while to return here from my last visit and all I could remember about this place is that I left feeling quite full.  As I said in my prior review, this place rocks, still.\n\nInstead of venturing upstairs for our meal, we opted to sit at the bar where there would be minimal delay in our order and delivery of food.  Smart move.  I had myself a Yinzerita like I did the last time and I stayed with a burger, but this time I decided to try something new to me.  \n\nI had opted for the B3 burger.  Beef, bacon and barbecue sauce.  Don't just think of the bacon as on top of the burger, it's also mixed with the beef inside the patty.  Juicy as ever and with the right amount of tang from the barbecue sauce.  Pair this with a side of the fries and it's a mighty good meal that will remind you of what good finger food is.  However, from the time I visited until I wrote this review, I have heard a nasty rumor that the B3 is no longer available.  I visited their website recently and after looking over the menu section I do not see it listed.  That may mean that this burger is extinct.  If that is the case, that makes me sad.\n\nThe bartender on duty that ended up serving us was amazing.  She was helpful when we had a question about items on the menu and great at giving suggestions. Loved this spot! Came for New Years day. Mimosas were $8 a pitcher! They also had the game going. Although the kitchen was slow the food didn't look great but it tasted really good. I think one of the cooks called. But the vibe overshadowed the negative. The also played hip hop! Shout out to whoever made the playlist. I could stay there a few hours ....especially if they had a couch The atmosphere of local is very fun, which is why it gets more than one star.  This is especially true in the summer when the windows are open.  It makes for a great day drinking spot.  The drinks are also pretty good.\n\nNow to the bad.  The food is average.  I have never heard anyone I went there with be impressed with their meal.  I got a burger on my last trip there.  Ordered it medium rare and it came out dry and well done.  My wife's breakfast sandwich was soggy and lacked flavor.  It's the little things like this that are annoying about a place that has potential to be great, but just misses the spot.  The service is always slow and mistakes are made often. The menu here is extensive and relatively cheap considering the surrounding area. Stopped in on New Year's Day to a full bar and impeccable service. We were greeted with water and Tim happily made us a delicious mimosa carafe. Next time we are visiting we will gladly come here again. Local is the place to stop on Carson street! A great spot for our Friday night date night. We were seated right away at a table by the window. It was still happy hour and most drafts were half off. I tried e Shocktop Twisted Pretzel (kinda watery and flavorless) and my go to Leinenkugel Cranberry Ginge Shandy. My fianc\u00e9 had the Strongbow cider. Select apps were half off and we got the pretzel sticks and pierogies. Both were fabulous and left us too full for dinner. The pretzels are served with honey mustard and cheese. The pieogies have sauerkraut, kielbasa and onions on them topped with sour cream.  We put in a to go order for our entrees and got a side salad, boneless wings and a flatbread pizza. The takeout did not stay good for long so  it would have been best to have just eaten the dinner there. Our fantastic waitress, Amanda, talked us into the pretzel brownie which was to die for - a fudge brownie with whipped cream, chocolate sauce and crushed up pretzels.  A great dinner and we will be sure to be back. I want to start off by saying I ate this sober, so my review is completely objective. In a city filled with phenomenal pie, Benny's surprised me by holding its own. As other reviewers have stated, the slices are big. Like bigger-than-your-head big. The pizza had a nice cheese to sauce ratio (heavy on the cheese). The bottom crust was slightly thinner than I prefer, but the end crust was thick and doughy. I did find it a bit greasy, but for $5 a (gigantic) slice, what more could you ask for?\n\nCompared to its competition, this is for sure the best pizza in South Side. Love Pages! The ice cream is well worth the line! I love that they incorporate other local treats into their menu and think it is great to see everyone supporting each other. It is always so sad to see them close and I look forward to them opening! I love the Nancy B cookie sundae! Whole wings are awesome, had smoked dry with original sauce on the side . If ordering a sandwich you will be sharing or taking home. Very good. Top five foodie places of all time.  \n\nWe returned as vegetarians.  They made me a specialty burger with a black bean patty instead of meat.  \n\nThis is a meat lovers paradise though.  The sandwiches are off the charts.  The fries perfect and cooked till they are dark in color.  The chips weren't our favorite so substitute.\n\nThe beer is top notch.  Make sure to order one of their labeled specialty brews.  I love Belgian beer too so try a tripel.  \n\nFood quality has stayed consistent for the dozen years we've been going as tourists from out of town.  \n\nTop five of all time in our book. Huge menu, tons of craft beers to choose from. Fatheads sandwiches are pretty good for the most part but the biggest takeaway from this review needs to be the SMOKED WINGS.. get them. I get extra medium but obviously whatever your preference is. I have also had the hipster cheesesteak here which is hot sausage and steak and it was very good. Great spot for pierogi also if you have an out of towner! Fat... everythings. Objectively, this is a great place if you want a wide beer selection and pub food on steroids; neither of those things are particularly appealing to me. Basically, if you don't drink or are on a diet, you might not love it. But if you want to imbibe and ingest all the burgers and chips, you'll probs love it. Be forewarned, the portions are enormous... I ate my burger in two separate meals. If you want more variety than fried foods, not a lot of options here. Good for groups and celebrations though. I've been here to drink but never ordered any food before tonight. This place is great! Perfect laid back atmosphere and the service was fantastic. The bartenders were friendly and knowledgeable. I will definitely be back!! The bloody Mary's here are outstanding, simple but full of flavor! Draft selection is great here. Thank you for a wonderful experience Smiling Moose. I'd recommend this place to anyone looking for a good drink and friendly service. Great little neighborhood bar & grille; old school, but warm and inviting inside. I happened to stop in on dollar burger night so I could not resist ~ seriously? $1 for a perfectly respectable burger? This might be my new watering hole! The bar maid was friendly and the customers, the usual mix of young guys, couples and groups of friends. I was pleased to see a diverse mix of ages & races, male & female. If you are looking for something low key & casual i would definitely recommend this pub! Such a sweet little place! We ordered the Buffalo Chicken Pizza, Chicken Quesadilla, and an order of 5 chicken wings. The best thing was definitely the pizza! Best buffalo pizza I've ever had!", "stars": 3.8}, "South Side Slopes": {"year": 2015, "text": "I didn't show up to UUBU6 expecting a great meal. However, it's a neighborhood place in a funky old Union building with a bunch of regulars and 2 dollar beer special. It's the only restaurant in the South Side slopes, and you can't hate a neighborhood joint.\n\n...unless they charge your credit card twice for your meal and you pay 40 dollars for a burger. Worse still, that very burger was an inedible 2 pounds of meat, burnt on the outside and raw on the inside, laying inside a tiny bun. Even the pickles from a jar tasted bad. My 10 dollar house red tasted bad. My expectations were low. But if the burger isn't even edible...come on.\n\nMaybe you could come here for a beer? But first just throw a frozen meal in the microwave at home. This was even more disappointing because we have tried to go to UUBU6 half a dozen times, but the hours are inconsistent. We've even shown up 30 minutes before closing time to find the door locked, and the waitress, Diane, just stared at us from down the hallway. \n\nPersistence did not pay off on this location. If you don't live in the neighborhood, don't even think of making the trip. If you want a \"cheap, divey spot\" there are plenty of other places on East Carson that serve bad food. It is quiet though. One star for being quiet and having local high school football on the tvs. Great little hidden place...friendly staff...great food! Diane (waitress) takes the cake though...she's hysterically awesome!!! My husband and I live in the neighborhood and by default, come to UUBU6 quite often for dinner during the week; lots of regulars from the Southside slopes here. \n\nThe food is usually a hit, rarely a miss (foie gras on waffles and guacamole on crabs are a resounding 'no' but most everything else? an absolute yes!). The usual American fares, as well as Eastern European ones, really shine here; never have I ever had better pierogies than at UUBU6, soft and pillowy while drowning in butter? Why, yes, I will happily stuff myself with these pierogies made of angel dust. That massive, delicious burger that comes on home-made buns is a must-try too! Everything comes in huge portions and we usually end up having to take half of our food home as next day's lunch. \n\nDon't miss dessert here, there is usually an excellent array of homemade tarts, pies, and cakes! Mike, the chef, makes all the desserts and the breads, which are consistently delicious -- I could eat Mike's apple tarte tatin everyday for the rest of my life happily. The beer specials (usually $2-$3/beer) don't hurt either. The servers, Tom (who wears many hats here, including bartender and co-owner with his brother Mike, the chef) and Diane, are great and are part of the reason why we keep coming back to this neighborhood joint!", "stars": 3.5}, "Squirrel Hill": {"year": 2017, "text": "One of my favorite places to chill and relax with friends. Quaint little place with a huge variety of tea and finger food. Definitely a unique place. Check it out it you aren't quiet in a mood to eat a whole meal with a friend or when going out for ice cream gets old. I really enjoyed the atmosphere and decor of this place. It's really different that they give you a bell to ring when you need something. I got the chai tea I didn't particularly like it I should have gotten it spiced it was just too plain for me. They have so many options to choose from it's hard to pick just one the prices are reasonable so you can definitely try a few different teas while you are there. They also have loose tea you can purchase to go. I definitely recommend this place. Always enjoy Dobra Tea as a place to relax and have a great conversation with friends. The inside is super cozy, with a range of colorful chairs, booths, and pillows to sit. I typically go for their tasting duo; two pots with contrasting flavors that you can enjoy back to back. It's enjoyable as all of the tea there is wonderful, and the staff takes time to explain the differences in flavor of the teas so that the customer can have a great experience.\n\nOur most recent visit was unfortunately a bit disappointing regarding the service. I was stopping in with my boyfriend and his sister visiting from out of town, and we were excited to show her the atmosphere at Dobra, as she is a huge tea fan. Since the menu has so many options, we wanted to start off with a tasting duo to sip while we look through the rest of the menu and decide what else to try. When I ordered the duo, I asked if it would be possible to include a third cup so each person could have their own. While this has never been an issue in the past (I have been in with groups of 3 or 4 and ordered the tasting duo), our server gave us a hesitant, but clear \"....no.\" He then proceeded to explain that the duo was intended for 1 or 2 people and would not be suitable for 3. After a few back and forths, and trying to explain that we were planning on ordering more but just wanted to start off with something first, he finally agreed to provide the third cup. \n\nWhile it's not a huge deal, and the server was friendly enough still - it kind of left an uncomfortable feeling for a bit - the embarrassing implication that we were somehow cheap customers or making an unreasonable request for trying to share an order. Especially since we had someone from out of town we were showing around, it left a poor impression. \n\nUltimately, though, it's just one negative experience out of many good experiences. Dobra Tea is a great tea house with a wide selection of teas, a beautiful interior, and knowledgeable staff. Definitely a must try for anyone in the area who enjoys a hot beverage! We were on a hunt to find our go-to pizza place in Squirrel Hill. After having Mineos a couple times we set to try Aiello's. And, as much as I wanted the pizza to be good, it just wasn't. The main ingredients of pizza are: cheese, dough and the sauce. We liked none of it, specially the cheese was bland and not tasty at all. So, that was our first and last time ordering at Aiello's. For now. I might give them another chance though since we order pizza often for weekends and it is priced reasonably. I've grown up eating pizza here. It used to be a institution. Now it's garbage. The workers are rude, the pizza was unrecognizable. Sad to see them fall off so badly. Not sure of the validity of these 5 star reviews for this hole.\nThe slices are itty bitty little shit ass things, barely enough substance to fill up a toddler or a granny.\nGrease laden, cracker- like triangles . won't go back, been there done that . unsatisfying as hell.\nStaff was friendly. Good coffee, but the real reason I come here is for the cheese cake. They sell very large and decadent slices for about $6. Nice place to study and in the summer they open up the big window and let the breeze in. My brother and I went to Chengdu Gourment Christmas day during the evening.  It was nice that they were open during Christmas.  Then again, it seems that most Asian restaurants are open.  For our appetizer, we got the Scallion Pancakes.  It was very good because it was very crispy on the outside and chewy and soft on the inside.  For our main dishes, we got the Spicy Fish Fillet in Flaming Pan and a Pork Belly dish where I can't remember the exact name of it.  They were both excellent.  The Fish Fillet was fried and crispy on the outside, and succulent and juicy on the inside.  The spicy components of dish really put the fillet on another level.  The pork belly dish was great as well and its spiciness also got the pork belly to go to another level.\n\nThe service though could be better.  The waiter only went back to our table only once to refill our drinks.  Then even after we were done, we still had to wait 20 minutes to get our check.  We could gave the waiter his attention, but he should have recognized that we were done eating and asked if we wanted our check.  Owners of Chengdu Gourmet, please review with your staff on making sure they give customers the appropriate attention.\n\nThat being said, I would definitely come back to try other dishes. I can't recommend this place enough. Hands down the most 'authentic' Chinese food in the Pittsburgh area wiith mouth watering dishes that really make you question what you've been eating from all those other places this whole time. \n\nOne bone to pick, where I was staying was just outside their 3 mile delivery area so had to pick up. Also, particularly during the holidays, business is high, and they are short staffed so you might have to wait for front of house to get to you while taking phone orders, seating guests and cashing delivery orders. I highly recommend calling first and then picking it up. \n\nBut, aside from that unpleasantness, their food is exemplary, (orange chicken,  crispy duck and chicken dumplings are divine) and I can't wait to come back. My homebase CTR is the Fox Chapel location (which is LOVE) - so this is the first time I visited the Squirrel Hill location. It's a bit cramped in some areas, but there are also a variety of seating options (barstools/counter, front tables, back tables) throughout the space. And, with the garage door opening, I imagine it's nice in warm weather. During this visit, the wait was rather long. Neither of the baristas seemed able to answer any questions about their coffee drinks or variety of coffee beans, which was surprising since this is a coffee shop. Once we got through the initial line, our drinks were ready pretty fast. They were okay and prepared mostly as we had ordered them - although I had to repeat the order twice to both people. I can't say that my experience was as good as the Fox Chapel location but I am definitely still a CTR fan! Delicious!  Savory and sweet breakfast items are great here.  Their ingredients taste fresh, and they make a great veggie omelet. I love their Lyonnaise potatoes. Best I have ever had. My favorite hotcake is the banana walnut one. What I don't like about their omelette is that the fillings and the egg part are always separated and as you cut through the omelette they fall apart completely. So it feels like you have ordered scrambled eggs and a side of veggies/meat rather than an omelette. Although this might be a style, I am just not a fan of this type of omelette. There are a few Pamela's in the Pittsburgh area. This one happens to be in the heart of squirrel hill. If you didn't know Pamela's is Barack Obama's favorite restaurant in the city of Pittsburgh (however, he typically frequents the one in the strip). Pamela's is open for breakfast, brunch, and lunch. They are famous for their crepe style hotcakes and Lyonnaise potatoes. Their hotcakes are very thin and usually packed with goodies inside. My personal favorite is the banana chocolate chip ones. The Lyonnaise potatoes are the most scrumptious potatoes in the world. They are in between a home fry and hash style of potato with onions and lots of butter. I simply cannot go to Pamela's without ordering a side of them. The squirrel hill location has bottomless coffee for $2, which I also always enjoy. They can range between in expensive to moderate in price, depending on what you order. I would say that most people can find something delicious and filling within their budget here. \n\nThe only downside to this place is they are very popular, which means you are likely to wait for a seat. That being said, they are so worth the wait! It's a breakfast institution in the 4-1-2 for a reason, folks. Of course their famous crepe hot cakes are the sweet order, but show the savory side of your soul some love, too. The omelettes are generous and the Lyonnaise potatoes are THE best...they don't get any better than this. The pot o' joe on the table will remind you to look up from your food every now and again. Inhale. Exhale. Dive back in! I've always gone here instead of brueggers in order to support a local business. But today, when ordering a dozen bagels, I requested that they be cut since I was taking them to the office to be eaten immediately. They told me that they couldn't do it - it's their policy to only cut bagels if you call ahead. Doesn't help me much since I was already there. I said it was ok, I could wait for them to be cut. They said no, it's the policy. Can't cut bagels. At a bagel shop. I was dumbfounded. At the time, there was nobody in line and maybe 1-2 other people in the shop. There were two employees making food - one actively making a sandwich and one standing next to her. And another working the register. If they were extremely busy at the time I could understand this policy, but given the situation, I would have appreciated them to go the extra mile to provide proper service to a customer. And oh, not cutting bagels... At a bagel store... Very strange policy. nice stone bowl rice I really like their vermicelli dishes, and you get a really big portion for the price. I've only had the pho once but it tasted really bland to me so I have not re-ordered, but my friends do enjoy it so it's probably worth a try. Their quality of food and service are consistently good every time I've been there and I will keep coming back to grab a quick bite to eat in Squirrel Hill. We had dumplings, potstickers, beef braised noodle soup and wonton soup. All of it was great. They forgot my bubble tea, but service was good. This place is always busy. Food is ok. The soup dumplings are worth the trip. If you go at lunchtime they might take until the end of your meal to arrive. Everyday Noodles is amazing. All of the Noodles are made in house.\n\nI can't even list a recommendation for a noodle or dim sum. They are truly all that good.\n\nAs a note, they don't do spicy. If you're looking for spicy, you will be disappointed. The spicy dishes aren't spicy. We always order too much food and leave so full!  Seriously, the soup dumplings blew my mind - there is soup INSIDE the dumpling- how magical is that? And the taste is delicious.  Get the beef and tendon soup with the wide noodles - so delicious. Don't make a rookie mistake and order too many dumplings/apps they give you so much food you'll roll out of there full and with leftovers.\n\nIt's really a neat place where you can watch them handmake the noodles - it's really cool and the food is delicious! We came here as we saw that they had good reviews for soup dumplings. We did take out instead of dine in which might have influenced what we ordered. We ordered the drunken chicken, two rice entrees, something else that I don't remember and dumplings. The drunken chicken was delicious! It was tender and had great flavors. As for my rice dish, I wasn't too big of a fan. Initially I wanted to order the soup noodle version but decided against it since I was doing take out. The rice was dry and there was more rice than meat. My least favorite dish were the dumplings. I'm used to dumplings shaped like dumplings but these looked like they were melted. \n\nOverall, this place is not bad but I would want to try the soup dumplings and their noodles for next time. Just go and eat the dumplings please!! I will be back if I ever swing through Pittsburgh again. Amazing!! The waffles are sooo good! I wish I could eat them every day, or at least more often. But, calories, calories, calories... That is why I keep Waffallonia as a treat! Usually I get it with banana and nutella toppings. The only downside I think is that it is a bit pricy for a small-ish waffle. This was one my favorite dessert places. I make frequent visits. This particular occasion I got to Waffalonia about a minute or two before close time and walked into the open door. The woman said \"we are actually closed\". We still saw freshly made waffles sitting on the counter. We made a special trip from across town so I could bring a friend who was visiting from out of town and had never been here before. We rushed to get here in time and even mentioned all of this to the woman. EXTREMELY disappointed in the lack of service. My wife and I decided to go here despite heavy rain that evening, and the effort wasn't a waste. When you seek to explore new cuisine, you want two things: (1) the food is good, and (2) there is staff in the restaurant that help you choose the right items. For this place, not only these two were satisfied, but also the guy helped us how to eat some of the items. For example, the soup dumpling - one should put it in the soup spoon to avoid wasting any of the soup. Amazing! We'll be back, we did try the shrimp and lobster sauce over rice and the  fried chicken over rice apart from the soup dumpling - but this is only our first time. Highly recommended! Five stars. Me and my husband been going to the same Asian food place in Sq Hill for a years. Then Cafe33 opened and now every week we going to this place since it's opened. We had tried many different dishes. They have really good food! Our favorite is Fish w/ Pickled mustard Soup. Big bowl enough for two to share and it's just $6,95! And if you love kimchi,  try Kim Chi Stir Fried w/chicken, you will not be disappointed! This is my favorite Taiwanese restaurant in Pittsburgh. The crispy pork chop noodle soup is finely made and served. \nSome special dishes are not on the menu so don't forget to ask for recommendations on the whiteboard. I absolutely love this place!! The place is cozy and well decorated. The staff was really friendly and very attentive. We came here on Friday night for dinner. Fortunately, it was early so we didn't have to wait for a table. Keep in mind that The tables are small and actually pretty close to the next table. \n\nWe ordered the sweet and sour pork chops, soup noodles, beef or pork stomach, pork belly sandwich and a warm milk bubble tea. The food came out really quick! I really enjoyed the warm bubble tea and the sweet and sour pork chops which came with a small bowl of rice. It was amazing! I don't remember if it was pork or beef stomach but it was good. The dish was cold with a kick of spice. \n\nOverall, I really enjoyed my experience and I can't wait to come back to try the other dishes! I would definitely recommend this place! Got a rueben and fries. Food was incredibly slow. 32 minutes for takeout for this small order. Way too slow for a deli.\n\nAs for the food. The fries were delicious, absolutely loved them. Rueben was sloppily made. Some parts were dry, some parts had too much sauce. Corned beef was just okay too. A little cheweyer than I'd have expected. Would have given 4 stars based no food but 32 minutes is an entire lunch break Stopped today for lunch with my daughter and as usual we were not disappointed. I have been a regular customer for about 4 years and have never had a bad meal. Today was a little different in that the regular cook was off sick and the manager was behind the grill cooking so service was a little slow. Not one word of complaint. Had the pastrami on rye with a bowl of chicken noodle soup. daughter had egg salad on sour dough both very large portions and we weren't disappointed. Good parking behind the restaurant and very convenient to get to Excellent pizza.  Love the sauce, cheese was crazy, like a double cheese pizza.  Pepperoni is thick and meaty.  Crust is somewhere between thick and thin, just right.  Nice Craft beer selection too.  Would definitely eat here again. Love Mineo's pizza! We usually order traditional crust with onions/spinach/mushrooms. It is just AMAZING! The cheese they use for the pizza is the best I have had in Pittsburgh. So good! And I love their dough too, thin in the middle and thicker on the outside. And it tastes great! \nI know they have other food items too, and we want to try them as well, but the pizza is just so good that we always end up ordering that. Mineo's is one of my favorites. Even when I was newly pregnant and sick as a dog - I could still stomach a slice of their pizza! So anyways, we came for lunch on a Saturday.\n\nCrust is thin on the bottom. Lots of sauce (I prefer light sauce, but..) and heavy cheese that you can literally eat off your pizza with a fork which is my favorite part.\n\nThe wedding soup was kind of slimey, so I probably wouldn't order that again.\n\nSome negatives about this place:\ncash only / which would be totally fine except we bank out of state so we very very rarely carry cash.\n\nParking / minimal street parking.. it was freezing so we were trying to avoid walking far but we didn't luck out with on street parking.. we used the metered parking lot 2ish streets down.\n\nIt was also kind of dirty but the staff was well aware and extremely attentive. Once we picked a table, they came over and cleaned it. They were also very very kind at the counter. Stopped by this locale for soup and sandwiches 'to go' today and was appalled by the conversation between 3 employees standing around the bar.  One asked the other two if they had ever 'child molested a cat' and then went on to ask why child molesters are so vilified!  First and foremost - abhorrent ignorance is alive and well.  Secondly, awareness of your surroundings while conversing at work is obviously not a requirement to work at the Murray Avenue Grill.  As I left I told the bartender I had hoped I misunderstood their conversation and was told 'that's why we call him a freak'.  NEVER going back and recommend the same for all.  Management must hold employees accountable for their actions AND words in front of customers. I got takeout from this place a while ago for lunch when I pass by. It was fast, authentic and tasty. I haven't checkout there dinner yet but I've heard that this is one of the most authentic Chinese restaurant in Pittsburgh. Maybe I will check it out soon. How did I never review this place before? ONLY order off the traditional Sichuan style menu on the back page, and you cannot lose. We eat here so often. My fav items are The Chingqing dumplings and I always reserve the sauce it's in to put over the rice since it is SO good. I love the beef and fish hotpots (this is the only meal I prefer in restaurant than take out).  The baby bokchoy is garlic heaven, and the stir fried green beans  and salty and pork-y. The eggplant is also good as is the spicy dry hot chicken.  We have never gone wrong with the Sichuan menu; plus ask a server for a suggestion.  Ooooh, and it is byob. Me and my wife went for a dinner here today. Order didn't showed up for half an hour. And the food quantity not justified for the price at all. \n\nMost insane stuff - I gave a tip of 10% considering all the suffering, stepped out of the restaurant and the waitress ran out and caught us for more tip. She acted like they were so great and amazing that they require minimum 15% tip. I hate that attitude. Very bad experience. \n\nNot recommended at all! Let me get right to the point:  I ordered a lamb gyro, and it barely had any meat in it.  It was not 'bad', but I felt like I just paid 'meat prices' for what was essentially a lettuce wrap.  With so many other restaurants around, my advice to them would be:  Don't cut corners, because in the end you'll lose more money from lost business than what you'd save by skimping on meat.\n\nService was friendly - server was not slow, but the kitchen seemed a little slow all things considered.  Atmosphere was ok.  I won't be back. So a friend and I were heading to Pittsburgh to see La La Land since it wasn't playing where we lived and really wanted to see it, especially in a big theater and we thought we'd eat lunch before. Turkish Kebab House was definitely the right choice. Probably the best gyro I've ever had. Seriously. Loved it. The lamb gyro was presented on a plate with lettuce with bread on the side. And hell, it was just as good as a salad. Seriously, get the lamb. So as I stop rambling on about good lamb, take a chance and try out this little place. Be cultured and adventurous, it'll be worth it. Normally I'm not but hey, it's a good New Years resolution to try more things. I got two things here:  some sort of chocolate muffin, and an apricot scone.  Both were very good, and the prices were reasonable.  Everything was fresh, flavorful, and I could see all kind of things being made and freshly baked as I made my purchase.  Not much in the way of seating, and a little hard to notice from the street unless you know where it is, but I'll be back to try more things here.  I would be prepared to make my order 'to go' though. I ordered a plain large cheese pizza through yelp on a Sunday night. It arrived in a little over an hour, and it was cold and the box was crushed. In the past I've had other problems like getting the wrong order delivered to me and then having to wait for them to remake my order and bring it again. My boyfriend and i order from here once a week...we love the pizza...there sauce is the best. Fast delivery!!! I love this local treat. The baked goods are wonderful and I love the coffee. I love that you often see the local owner enjoying conversation with friends and customers -  it's a great little spot to work or run in an grab a smoothie. I've tried almost everything on the menu and have loved it all. Ramen can be the best to warm your insides on a cold, bitter day. There's certainly a lot of those days in Pittsburgh.\n\nI was pretty excited to find out about the Ramen Bar, and was recommended to come here by a few others. While the portions of noodles and broth, there was a lack of vegetables and meats. My Ramen Ramen dish had only a few bean sprouts a single slice of pork. It was great for flavoring the broth, but the meat itself was terribly overcooked.\n\nMy partner ordered the seafood ramen, which for $4 more than my dish, and included only two shrimp and and two mussels. \n\nI also wish a spoon had been offered. I struggled to eat my ramen with chopsticks. While we were getting ready to leave, I saw everyone at the table next to ours ask for spoons and forks. I felt kinda silly not asking at that point, but a soupy dish is not easy to eat using chopsticks.\n\nI do applaud the quick service and the hot meal, but I'm curious if I could find a better local ramen place. My wife and I stopped in here during an ice storm and it was just what we needed. It's perfect for a cold Pittsburgh day. We each got Ramen bowls with Shoyu Base. I got the Won Ton Men and she got the Vegetable Ramen. The bowls come out quickly and steaming hot which is great because it takes some time to eat the whole thing and it's still hot when you get to the bottom. The staff is friendly and seated us right away at the big table in the back with other parties. We went back a week later and had a similar experience, were seated right away but this time near the door. Ramen was hot and delicious both times. Will definitely go back often! This isn't ramen. Go visit any decent ramen restaurant in SF, LA, NYC, or just any other city with a good food scene. Their kimchee ramen is literally just a korean kimchee soup with terrible ramen soggy noodles. The \"ramen ramen\" dish tastes BASIC, like they used some instant powder and microwave to make the soup base. The \"tan tan men\" tastes like a hodge-podge of asian flavors that just leaves you with an impression of WTF? Seriously, this place is awful and I guess it's still in business because people haven't anything better to compare it with....but the flavors are still pretty bad. This is a place you'll want to visit multiple times to try all of the variety. The ramen noodle bowls are delicious, I had the curry ramen bowl and could overhear the table next to me ranting and raving about two entirely different dishes from the one I had before me... this place lived up to what I had heard about the taste, definitely not your average ramen packet and the prices are good for the value. Another pro, the service is friendly and prompt and you can get seated fairly quickly if you get in early enough on a Saturday night which is a bit of a transition into some of the downsides. The ramen bar (though in mentioning the name will plug another plus of byob) is certainly not a place that seems to encourage a good date night, the food comes fast, the check comes fast, they don't proactively ask about wanting dessert i.e. They want to clear tables, and the establishment is pretty small. They have one large table, but I'd encourage going elsewhere with a group. Also the appetizers seemed to be less than their forte (I tried the shrimp gyoza) so my suggestion go for a specialty ramen, with someone you want to spend a well served hour with, enjoy yourself and come back soon! Not the biggest place, and it's always busy, but the Ramen is the best.  Had the Tan Tan seafood Ramen and has a nice spicy kick to it  Also we had the pork Gyoza which is also very good. Couldn't pass up getting some Takoyaki so got an order to go. Would have been better hot but the soup was just to filling.  Been here many times and always good, but especially on a cold winters day. I came here with my parents and they were able to communicate to the waitress in Chinese as well as order from the Chinese menu. I thought it was funny that the first part of the menu showcases authentic Chinese dishes, and then the second part features Americanized Chinese dishes such as General Tso's, but this allows them to cater to everyone's taste! \n\nI was scared to try the Chinese dishes here at first because they have a reputation of being really spicy, but they weren't that bad! I would recommend getting a mix of spicy and non-spicy dishes for your first time - they are clearly marked on the menu, which is helpful. \n\nAll of the dishes we ordered were all really good and tasted authentic. The service was also great and the food came out quickly. We used the 8% off check-in offer from Yelp and had no problems with it.\n\nThe Squirrel Hill location definitely looks more upscale than the Oakland one, and was well decorated. I will be coming back again! Good food, great prices. They don't skimp on ingredients or quality, on both the Chinese and Chinese-American menus. Those other places can keep their stir fried rice and General Tso's chicken- which admittedly can still be good at times. But this stuffffff... Oh my. \n\nWe were six people. We got five dishes. One had lamb. One had chicken, with a flaming ember still underneath. Another had pork. I think there was a beef, and one of green beans. And we set them all in the middle of the table and devoured them like a pack of hungry family members. Our waitress had helped us decide on what to order. She spoke broken English and yet was so helpful and nice and even helped with gluten accommodations. There are so many possible ways to prepare such ingredients, and yet with Sichuan Gourmet's way of cooking, I simply could not ask for a tastier meal. \n\nAnd then, complimentary orange slices at the end of the meal. The option of ordering pork brain. Eight percent off total bill when you check-in with the Yelp app. Inviting atmosphere, borderline almost upscale, unlike the bland food-getting place it could so easily be. I will return to Sichuan Gourmet forevermore when I need real Chinese food. \n\n***With credits to my Malaysian friend and my Taiwanese friend for having previously introduced me to such a way of eating.*** This is a good little spot for Chinese. They recently remodeled the place. I love how they always have the Yelp coupons! Staff is friendly and the atmosphere is nice. I like how they offer online ordering. My personal favorites here are General Tso's and Beef w Broccoli. Also the location is prime... right on the 61C bus line. I've been here a few times now and I just love it! I always stop when I am in Squirrelhill. My most absolutely favorite thing is the bun! It may sound strange to newcomers but it is so delicious and you must try it! There are many different flavors which vary from time to time. I recommend getting there early because they will go fast! The only other thing I've tried is the cheese bread which is also good. I highly recommend checking this place out if you are in the area. I look forward to returning and trying other items, especially more buns! The prices are pretty average for any bakery I think and the staff is always polite and helpful. Shop is small inside as could be expected from this type of establishment, but there are a few tables to sit if you want. Can't wait to come back! Classic dive sports bar! Waffle fries were hands down the best I've ever had. Great amount of beers on tap. Came here for game day but was surprised it wasn't busier. 50 cent wings on game day (wings were just OK). Will definitely be back next time we're in Squirrel Hill!! This was a cool little spot! I got the Puerto Escondido, which was killer and the cup was a cactus so I love that. I would describe the atmosphere as cozy-chic, which is how I love to live my life. I didn't sample the food, but my friend got the nachos and they looked great. The prices were a little higher than your standard bar, but you're paying for the experience and I can respect that. Hidden Harbor is really good. The drinks are fantastic and the menu is really well laid out. I've had consistently excellent service.\n\nWhen you arrive, they offer menus almost immediately. I've only ever had a 15-20 minute wait for a table or space at the bar.\n\nThe drinks are well made and they have a nice selection of stronger and fruitier drinks. The menu is really self explanatory of giving you an idea of what you're getting. While most drinks are rum based, they have vodka and whiskey based items as well. It's a really nice mix. \n\nIf you can get a spot at the bar, I'd recommend it. I enjoy seeing all the different drinks made. \n\nI haven't had the food, but it looks good. Super cute. Very friendly staff. Delicious drinks.\n\nWho doesn't want to escape a grey Pittsburgh day and pretend you're in the tropics? My husband and I heard about Hidden Harbor from a couple people and decided to try it out for Happy Hour. I ordered a Daiquiri and he ordered an Old Fashioned. The Daiquiri was made with Maggie's Farm Rum, which is local, and it had the perfect amount of alcohol- not crazy strong, but it had a kick. Besides that, of course it had a Tiki Bar feel, and I really enjoyed the music- it was older beachy music. I'd be curious to try the food and some of the other drinks but my first impression was great and I would definitely recommend. Went to Hidden Harbor with a big group of friends- we were able to sit in the large area with benches and coffee tables (the rest of the bar is filled with typical tables). It was a great area to be able to walk around, talk with everyone, and not be cramped. Drinks are on the expensive side (cheapest mixed drink is $10). However, this would be the first time that I would justify the price- they are very unique and each clearly takes time to put together. The food menu is limited, so I wouldn't recommend it as a dinner stop. It is a great place to stop for drinks after dinner though. Very chill atmosphere and nice decor. Delicious gluten free pizza! Crispy crust, flavorful meat topping. Fresh side salad. Delivered quickly. Loved it. On a hunt to find our favorite pizza place in Squirrel Hill, we ordered onion pizza fro Pastoli's. I liked the dough and sauce, not so much the cheese, it was quite bland. This is how Mineo's won the battle! Te Cafe is one of my favorite spots in Sq. Hill! In the winter, the windows are usually nice and foggy, providing the coziest feel when you're settling in with a hot cup of tea. They also have a nice selection of pastries and sushi, so you can snack or have a tasty meal while you're there to compliment your drink. Their chai tea latte is deeeeelicious as well, highly recommended! Great prices, great service, great food & drink :) This is legit the best Dunkin in the city.  The staff is always so cheerful and upbeat, without being annoying. Every single time! And, the coffee is always hot. No Luke warm cups from them. Sooooo... the Raz is my standard froyo place, the gold frozen standard  actually, I don't think they're called Razzy Fresh anymore, but anyway... I love them for 3 reasons: 1) they always have fresh ingredients, especially their fruit 2) they're reasonably priced and 3) they're open a lot, so if it's mid day on a Friday or late on a Saturday night, I can get my razzy fix  Here's my recommended concoction: 1/2 tart 1/2 raspberry yogurt, peanuts, strawberries, raspberries, blueberries; it tastes delicious, tart, healthy, and refreshing; seriously, one of Squirrel Hill's finest pleasures. Also, the owner is very friendly and they take cards without a minimum. Enjoy! Really really average\nI frequently visit Thai and Asian restaurants in Pittsburgh and was excited to try something new. I picked up my order and took it home only to realize my order had been made with beef and not chicken. The noodles were soggy and bland. The price was steep for such an average tasting meal. We ordered the see ew noodles and the chili paste beef. It wasn't terrible and the location is good. Over priced for what you get compared to the other restaurants in Pittsburgh A little difficult to find this place since the location on yelp is a little inaccurate. But the chicken gyro is great!  Soft flatbread(and a little sweet?I like it), delicious chicken, good price. A little bit large, haha. The service is good, too. I have Thai food all over the city.  Needed a  to go lunch in between appointments and a coworker recommended.  I got the Green Curry Lunch Special.  Salad was OK, soup was bland.  Ordered it \"Thai hot\" (8-10 ).  It was maybe a 3. Four shrimp and only one piece of eggplant. Won't return as there are better options within 5 miles I had Salmon chushee. And my husband had Kho soi. Both dishes were so good. I want to go back to try Tom yum noodle. Okay so I normally like Sukothai, but I have to start this review by saying that they have really terrible Pad Thai. It was so bad that I couldn't even finish it the next day. I don't know why its so bad, but I hate it. I will never order it again. Besides the Pad Thai, everything else I have had there has been good. The angel shrimp, vegetarian crispy roll, drunken noodles, and different curries. I love their vegetarian crispy rolls and they have good lunch specials. We usually order take out, but have enjoyed eating in the restaurant on multiple occasions. It is very clean with great service. An hour to delivery less than a mile. And the broth of the House Noodle Soup was so weak it was inedible. I come to this place often. The Taiwanese chicken is a favorite of mine. It's slightly spicy ( but not too powerful ). It's a wonderful environment & the service is always great. They usually have amazing bubble tea but my last experience there the tapioca pearls were kind of hard recently they got a consumer alert from the health department see link below.\n\nhttp://www.post-gazette.com/life/dining/2016/12/14/Rose-Tea-Cafe-in-Squirrel-Hill-Pittsburgh-hit-with-consumer-alert/stories/201612140188 We been going for years to this ice cream store. Not enough that over the years size's of the ice cream got smaller, but staff super rude. Please take your money somewhere else. I really love that they clearly make an effort to employ a diverse group of people.  Not the biggest selection, but it's not supposed to be a Market DIstrict or a huge warehouse store- and I'm glad it isn't. My friend and I came here for dinner before a show at the Carnegie Music Hall at Homestead and it was the perfect start to a wonderful evening. We both enjoyed the variety of sushi. Everything we ate tasted fresh, and was well flavored, which is not an easy balance for buffet style service. \n\nAnd yes, while technically a \"chain\" restaurant it's nice to have an option besides the franchises at the Waterfront in this part of town. I also appreciate the signs on the table warning against wasting food and asking patrons to only take as much as they will eat. It was a subtle reminder that just because this is an \"All You Can Eat\" establishment, it's not a challenge. Take as much as you want, but don't be wasteful--important message! One of the better Asian buffet in town.  I only got to try the lunch buffet. Reasonably priced and pretty good quality overalls. Get real busy early afternoons. Was here on a Tuesday on the way to a movie at the waterfront at about 4pm. I've always thought Hokkaido was way better than your average Chinese/sushi buffet. Shame on me for going on an off hour. The soups had skin on them, the shrimp was cold and mushy, and all the sushi had been sitting. NONE of the hot food was hot. Think this place is good when it's packed because it means the food is continuously replenished. It's not really right that I paid the price for a VERY substandard experience - they should close in between meals if they can't maintain quality. It's really cheap. I went for the lunch, it only cost me 10$! However, the food quality is not good... the sushi bar is ok. The crab is not fresh and overcook... however it provides a variety of food, including Chinese food, habachi, Hong Kong dim sum, western food, and chocolate fountain!!\nThe food I think it's ok are Chinese food, sushi, and chocolate fountain. They said for the dinner, they will provide other kind of crab and oysters which cost you around 18$.\nYou can give it a try since it's so cheap... if you want drinks, it will cost you extra (2$ for coke)... Commonplace is the best coffeeshop in Sq.Hill area. Perfect cappuccino every time I order. Stop by if you in the area, they also have outdoor sitting area! I like the low-key vibe of this place...but they need to do a good hose down at night because it was a  little too funky with grime even for a rainy day in a hipster coffee house. \n\nCoffee was great, biscotti was ok. Wifi is free and there are tables around to sit at which weren't busy for 145 on a Tuesday. I had an Americano and it was done well. \n\nThere are beans for sale, some tee's and it's not too pretentious...but as with a lot of Millennial based businesses...there will be toques in the summer, minor beards, ugly sweaters and probably fixed-gear bikes parked out back. \n\nDon't hold it against them because the coffee is really good and they actually seem to give a rats ass about recycling ~ yay! Very pleasant dining experience last night.  The wait staff make you feel very welcome.  Comfortable room.  And the food is very good.  I ordered Chicken Shawarama and Falafel.  The Falafel is very good. Crispy on the outside and very light inside.  My wife had the Lamb Shank and Pilaf which was very flavorful.  Also BYOB which is a nice treat.  I recommend.", "stars": 3.9}, "Strip District": {"year": 2017, "text": "The Strip District Pittsburgh Popcorn Company location is my favorite because of its vintage, industrial d\u00e9cor and its employees. The people who work there are polite, honest and truly try to give you the most popcorn they can in a bag- they are magicians in my opinion. The flavors are ever rotating, the prices are great and the compliments I get at parties on the popcorn I serve are endless. We utilized this shop for a huge order for our wedding, for Christmas instead of cookies and pretty much any event we can. I highly recommend checking them out and getting a few bags. The flavors really are wonderful and are great even mixed together. My review of this location is going to be similar to their downtown location...which is that YOU SHOULD GO HERE. \n\nGoing to a party and need a last minute idea? POPCORN. \nHousewarming party? POPCORN. \nHoliday present? POPCORN IN A FESTIVE TIN!\nSitting home by yourself and need a snack? POPCORN. \n\nGet a large Wisconsin Cheddar and thank me later!\n\nThis location gets very busy on the weekends, so be ready to wait in line for a little while if you show up on a Saturday afternoon. All of the guys that work here are very friendly and I've always had great service. It's well worth the wait! Great place to grab breakfast or lunch in the Strip District. Located on Penn Ave. Food ordered and paid for at the counter and brought out to you when it is ready. Prices maybe a few dollars more than I would have expected for this type of set up but it was very good so I don't really mind that. My husband and I ate for $29.00. Not huge inside so I could imagine it would get very busy on the weekends here. Business appeared clean. Restrooms for customers in the basement. \n\nMy husband had the blue cheese burger which he said was really good. Came with side of chips. The blueberry ricotta pancakes were fabulous and I highly recommend them to anyone who likes pancakes! The omelette was also excellently made with the perfect ratio of ingredients to eggs. \n\nLooking forward to coming back and trying one of their speciality sandwiches or salads! I've always had great food and service at Cafe Raymond. My favorite is the tomato mozzarella salad in a wrap... delicious!! Ended up going to Cafe Raymond with my fianc\u00e9 after we saw the lines for DeLuca's and Pamela's were both out the door.  It was a pleasant surprise! There was no wait and we walked right in, placed our order and grabbed a seat. We enjoyed some biscotti and coffee while we were waiting on our orders. I ordered the special of the day, which was the Southern Style Eggs Benedict, and she ordered an omelet. Our food arrived quickly and we both enjoyed it! The service was excellent as well. If you are down in the Strip, stop in and grab a good breakfast at Cafe Raymond, especially if you don't feel like waiting in a long line! Stopped in for lunch. Very nice staff and ordered the Rueben sandwich and it was amazing. Can't wait to come back for breakfast . Open 7 days a week! The Beerhive is a wonderful locals' spot in the Historic Strip District of Pittsburgh. The staff is absolutely fantastic, the beer selection is  top-notch, and the menu is some damn fine bar fare - including great variety of wings sauces and solid vegetarian pub food selections. Very good original Polish deli.  It is nice to find something authentic and good.  Thank you. Friendly folks, huge portions of delicious food, and super affordable. What else do you want?\n\nMy wife and I found ourselves on Penn Ave at the Milk Bank for baby classes (we're expecting our first child), and during our lunch break we decided to walk here because we saw the brightly painted building on the way to our class. Boy, were we glad we did. This place is a gem, and I can't wait till our next class so I can stop again.\n\nFirst, the dude (didn't get his name) getting our food was unbelievably friendly while waiting on us. I got the Chicken Tikka Masala, and was going to order steamed veggies for my side, but he suggested the spinach. It was fantastic and I'm glad i took him up on it. It was creamy, had little chunks of tofu I believe, and most of all, had incredible flavor. The chicken masala was the best I've had. He loaded my container with rice and chicken masala. My wife got the Chicken Tandoori, and I ate her leftovers a couple days later. Just the right amount of spicy.\n\nSome people sitting next to us got garlic naan and I'm definitely getting that next time I stop. It looked incredible. I'll probably get a gyro next time too because i've heard really good things\n\nThey also have a market connected to the grill with lots of interesting finds....Halal meat being one, if you're interested. During the holidays stopped by the Salem's Market to buy a few items and some meat from the butcher area.  Very helpful staff at the butcher counter.\nWe also stopped in the Grill for a quick meal.  Most others have already covered the essentials...ie;  cafeteria style, give you a number and they will bring it to you or you get up and get it when you number is called...someone was cleaning the tables and trying to keep up with the number of customers but it was busy.  I had the Kufta sandwich and fries.  The Kufta was very tasty and as others have said, the fries are really good.  For dessert had a pistachio mamaol that was delicious. If you looking for Gyros, Sharamas, fresh baked items Mediterranean sweets this a good place for a meal or taking home. If you are a fan of Indian food then this is the place for you.  The market has a private lot where you are warned to park at your own risk but makes it handy since parking in the Strip district can be a nightmare.\n\nOn one side is the market where you can purchase all types of meats and canned goods, etc to prepare and Indian style meal. The other side is cafeteria style where you can order meals, salads, gyros, or sandwiches.\n\nSince I was having lunch with my son he ordered his favorite which was tandoori chicken and chili chicken. It came with vegetables and an Indian rice platter. I decided to settle for a lamb gyro since there was a sign that stated \" if you are ordering a prepared entree please allow 10 minutes.\" This is just a heads up if you are on a lunch hour as my son was. Cards and cash are accepted. If you order a sandwich or gyro then for a slight upcharge you can get French fries and a beverage of choice. You can order as take out as well.\n\nFirst of all portion sizes are enormous! For Indian food yes it is very spicy including the vegetables that caught me by surprise!  The lamb gyro was just okay but I really enjoyed the French fries! My son and I were sharing our dishes and believe me we both ended up taking food home with us.\n\nI would recommend that if you come here then as another reviewer noted bypass the gyros and prepared sandwiches and go for the authentic Indian food. Most of these foods are very spicy. However, I must say that you'll never go wrong with their French fries. They are one of the best I have anywhere! Initially went there for all you can eat BBQ and found out they are only available Sat and Suns. So we ordered a sushi boat- standard but fresh fish. \nBBQ platter-tasty but too little. \nCrab salad-yum, must order but very spicy.  \nSo good we ended up order two or three more refills.\nSeaweed salad-must order\nFried gyoza- so good that we had refills too.\nTofu spicy soup-a good warm up soup with a lot of vegetable in there. \n\nService was very good too. But I feel like not all the stuff speaks English. But it makes me feel like their food is authentic because the stuff speaks Korean. \n\nThis place is like hidden spot on penn ave. I'm glad we found this place and will try their all you can eat BBQ shortly! Changing my review to a ONE . They said \"oh you want extra ban chan that costs extra\".\n\nNEVER have I gone to a Korean restaurant and been charged extra for refills on side dishes. \n\nI will NEVER come here again. EVER! Came here for sushi. It was good! Nice service. I would come back again. They forgot one of our rolls but ended up bringing it out at the end. It was good. It's been a long time since I've been to Sushi Kim.  I remember it being better.  Honestly I probably didn't make the best food choices to highlight their sushi offerings, but...\n\nOkay, the above average...though she hovered a bit, the waitress was attentive (very).  On the plus side that meant we got anything we wanted quickly.  On the minus side...there was a 'rushed' feel.  Like...please eat and get out.  \n\nThe salmon I got was great.  As was the jap chae.  The bi bim bob (sic) was a bit on the bland side, and the rice didn't have that crunch but it was fine.  The gyoza was good.  The miso was good.  The kim chi was good.  I ordered bulgogi sushi, but didn't really consider the fact that it would be basically a beef roll.  That was disappointing, but it tasted \"fine\".  \n\nThe place was more or less empty and the decor had a cobbled together slightly shabby feel.  The fountain at the front of the restaurant was as empty.  They seem to have accumulated various kitschy decorative items to line the half walls that separate the dining area from the bar, and they were a bit dusty, which lent itself to that air of protracted benign neglect.    Upstairs seemed empty (korean barbecue) but I didn't venture up to see.  \n\nWhen the waitresses weren't actively serving patrons, they hid behind bamboo and watched, which is actually moderately amusing when you consider it.  *you can't see me...i'm invisible!!*\n\nIf there's a next time, it will probably be just for sushi.  Maybe takeout. Rolands is a place that I usually go to for a drink before or after dinner or after work since I work close by.  We last stopped here on New Years Eve before dinner at a nearby restaurant.  They have a full food menu at Rolands but looking at other reviews and taking to other people that have eaten here I prefer to just order drinks here.  \n\n I think this is a good place to watch a sporting event at.  It's usually always busy and a good atmosphere for a big game.  The both upstairs and downstairs bars are laid out nice and open.  The televisions are big and you can easily see them.  I like that a lot.  \n\n Good for Rolands that they are busy and the bar is always crowded.  It's just hard to get a beer most of the time.  I don't know if the bartender's are just overwhelmed or not paying attention but it has been difficult to get a drink at first every time I come in here.  \n\n They usually have a good amount of drinks on tap which is nice.  If you have a large group the can accommodate you too.  We have had some unofficial events after work here that have been nice.  I just wouldn't order any food here unless I was really hungry and needed an appetizer or something small to get by.  \n\n     So if you're looking for a good place to hang out and watch some sports with some friends I recommend coming here to have some drinks but there are better places to eat close by in the Strip. Great drinks + sports!!!!!!! The seafood is super fresh!!! Perfect for a late dinner! Ordered the clam chowder. It came out barely warm. The calamari was terrible unless you like calamari the size of Texas onion rings. There were a lot of people there, so maybe it's just a good place for drinks, but if you're looking for good food, go elsewhere. The food was fresh and fabulous. The service was great and friendly. It is not a stuffy upscale seafood place, but you would never know it by tasting the food. The lobster rolls were great with plenty of meat. The crab cakes were full of crab and not filler. The clam chowder was exactly the way it should be with a real clam in just about every bite. We ate upstairs, which seemed to be a little more casual than the downstairs area. There is a large bar too if you prefer to eat at the bar rather than a table. We unfortunately did not have room to fit a pizza, but they looked really good as well. It will definitely be on the list for a return visit. Seem to return here every few months due to location and their balcony is fun when the weather is nice. The food and service is generally ok. We were there on 1/6/17 for happy hour which is decent.  As we were enjoying our drinks, I spotted a mouse hanging out behind the bar.  A bit unnerved,  I pointed it out to the waiter.  \"OK thanks\" he said and that was it. No one else came to investigate and no one seemed to think it was a big deal.  Needless to say  my appetite was gone.  Where is the health dept when you need them? Fantastic !  Croissants, melees, breakfast sammiches.....just incredible ! I live many miles away in Chicago so I only get to enjoy their namesake sandwich on my infrequent visits to the burgh to see family.  This is the best sandwich in town.  As a Pittsburgh kid I grew up loving some liverwurst on white bread with mayo. (and still do).  Thin Man elevates those basics with a sandwich that incorporates new and old Pittsburgh. Went for lunch. A lot of the sandwiches looked super creative. I ordered the capicola sandwich and while it was good, I am kicking myself for not trying something more adventurous. Sandwiches were reasonably priced and sized. Lots of options for vegetarians. Most of the menu is seasonal. All the more reason to go back. I will be visiting again. Had lunch for three here in early November -- my husband and I had a seasonal sweet potato and brussels sprouts sandwich and The Smash ($8.99, with goat milk marinated chicken breast, avocado, sprouts, lemon pickled onion, on a multigrain baguette), and my friend had a seasonal mushroom sandwich. The house-made seltzer and syrup ($2.79) were super tasty--I give that combo an A+. All of our sandwiches were tasty, but to be honest, the ratio of bread to stuff inside was a little too high on all three of them. So they are good for bread lovers. \n\nNone of us were particularly full at the end of the meal, but we were okay with it because we were trying to keep it light before we all had early dinners. But if I were trying to fill up, I definitely would have needed to try one of their tasty-sounding soups, salads, and sides. \n\nBathrooms were clean and smelled lovely, and the staff was personable and kind. It took a little bit of a wait before the sandwiches were ready, so don't expect to be in and out.\n\nOverall, 3 and a half stars, but I'll round up and go to 4. If I were in Pittsburgh again, I would give it another whirl. I'm so happy (but not surprised) to report that Asado, Gaucho's food truck, is just as impressive and delicious as the Gaucho restaurant! I am very lucky to have friends who used the food truck for their engagement party. I was not involved in the planning/logistics of the event so I obviously cannot comment on the experience of working with them, but the spread of food, quality, and time in which they got the whole party served was wonderful! The meats were as delicious as always - juicy and cooked to perfection. When I am in the restaurant I always go for the steak options, so I took this opportunity to try out the chicken and sausage. Oh em gee, I may have found some new favorites to bring into my rotation!\n\nThis was a huge hit with everyone at the party and I really recommend it. If I ever need catering or something of the sort, I'm going to be sure to book the Asado truck early. We recently had New Year's Eve dinner at DiAnoia's Eatery. \n It was fabulous!!!!  It was a fixed menu, but the options were outstanding.  The steak florentine was out of this world.  Also, the greens and beans were delicious - different than a lot of other Italian places, they were more beans than greens.  The porchetta was to die for!!!!!  The crudo was simple with just olive oil, lemon and branzino - so darn good!!!!! \nWe did opt for the premium wine pairings and they perfectly complemented our meals.  \nI can not wait to return when I can choose from the entire menu.  DiAnola's is a wonderful addition to the Pittsburgh dining scene. I went here for brunch this past Sunday with a group of friends.  Let me start by saying how great the space is....bright, roomy...the perfect place for brunch.  The service is also excellent.  Our waitress was to the point but very good at her job and clearly was concerned about making sure that everything was perfect.   In terms of food, we started by sharing the Italian doughnuts and ricotta pancakes.  The doughnuts were fresh and tasty but nothing spectacular however the pancakes were excellent.  For my meal I ordered the frittata with stew meat, however, since they were out of beef they substituted crab.  It was tasty but a little too crabby/fishy in flavor than I would have liked.  My wife had the eggs with arbiatta sauce which I tried and thought were excellent.  I would love to come back here for dinner sometime soon. I booked a large party for my birthday and the staff was very accommodating. They gave us this beautiful wooden table that had a lot of character. The interior design of the restaurant is extremely beautiful. There is a lot of lighting as well. The music was very tasteful although we couldn't hear too much of it in the dining area. Our waiter, Rod, made sure that things kept flowing all night long and did a good job in making everyone feel respected and appreciated. Everyone at the table really enjoyed their dishes. We brought tiramisu cake from outside and they were very accommodating in letting us eat the cake there. It was hard getting a reservation for 7 PM so we had to change to 5 PM but we never felt rushed to leave. Overall, everyone had a fantastic time and will be returning.\nThank you for making my birthday memories so delightful Been 3 times. Different times of day and days of the week. Each time coffee ran out. If they want to be called a \"caffee\", they should make sure they have some! Each time we had to tell staff coffee was needed....they should be monitoring. There are 2 containers....when one is empty, refill it! You pay in advance but if there is no coffee, too bad. Staff was unconcerned. Even after we had finished our meal....still no coffee made. Kinda wanted it with my meal.  We left without our prepaid coffee and no one offered a refund.  Just took my cup and never returned!\nWe live close by and had hoped this could be our new neighborhood place. Our sever was a nice young man but that's were it ended. Sat at table for 15 minutes before he came by, dropped off menus, he apologized for the delay and asked if we wanted drinks, I told him to give me few minutes to look at wine list to order a bottle. After another 15 minutes he returned took wine order and was gone for another 15 minutes or more only to tell me the wine I ordered was not in stock  and another apology. Selected another wine only to have server take the order then wait on 2 other tables as we sat for 20 more minutes without anything but water on our table, when finally bringing the second bottle ordered it was different vintage than on wine list and another apology. All awhile 4 other tables, some including our server, had sat after us, received drinks, appetizers and dinner. I don't understand how such a new restaurant would be out of the wine on the list, then serve a different vintage than what is on the list. I will say the food was very good but not at all worth the poor service. Pittsburgh can always use more restaurants that serve truly authentic Italian cuisine and Di'Anoia's is here to do just that. My husband and I went for dinner during restaurant week so we were able to take advantage of both the fixed menu and the a la carte one. But first - the ambiance! I've been to Italy a number of times and Di'Anoia's would fit in perfectly with the any side-street restaurants in Rome. It's amazing that the space was an old bridal salon, because it feels as though it was meant to be a restaurant - not at all forced. There are chandeliers made of bottles and wine glasses, and the tables are perfectly boutique styles. I also have to mention our waiter (maybe Eric - I'm so bad with names!). He was perfectly attentive and nice. You could tell that he loved working there (you can always tell a lot about a restaurant by their staff). \nWe first ordered the house wine (which is on tap) in a 3/4 bottle. You can definitely taste that it's from a tap, the first pour has that carbonated taste to it. Not a bad thing, just a bit strange. Served in an unlabeled bottle and with regular glasses, we felt transported into an Italian bistro right away. \nThe meal came with delicious thinly sliced focaccia drizzled with olive oil and balsamic. We both ordered appetizers: I had the greens and beans, my husband had the brussel sprouts. The greens and beans were delicious, I definitely recommend! The brussel sprouts were very different than what we expected. I will admit that we didn't notice if there was a description to them, and we didn't ask when we ordered. They are served with an almond cream-like sauce - I would even go as far as comparing the sauce as a soup versus a sauce. It was good, not what we expected but still pretty tasty. \nOur main courses were really heavenly: my husband ordered the gnocchi and I had the tagliatelle. I like j gobbled up my tagliatelle in roughly 15 seconds (maybe a little longer). It was really authentic. The noodles were perfectly handmade. The gnocchi and meatballs (and that sauce!) were also incredible. \nFor dessert, we shared the tiramisu. It was perfectly soaked and the espresso was delicious. I would definitely get it again. \nAll in all, I can't wait to go again and try more on the menu. Reading other reviews, it sounds like breakfast is a must too! Looking forward to making our way back! Omg this place! I had been reading about it for some time before I had a chance to make it in and luckily it did not disappoint! \n\nWe came for breakfast sandwiches before a quick food run in the strip. Our out of town guests were very impressed with the space and decor & I definitely was too! We sat at the bar and were quickly greeted by very friendly staff members.\n\nWe all ordered pretty basic breakfast sandwiches, but the options of meats to add was so good!!!! And such a refreshing change from all the other basic breakfast shops. \n\nI know after sampling breakfast that I need to make it back soon to have dinner. I already know I'll love it. I'm so happy to have them as a wonderful Italian food option in the Burgh! My husband and I decided to try this place before spending an afternoon shopping in the Strip. We arrived around 1:00 and the place was still busy for lunch. We enjoyed our lunch. We both had a panini. Mine was their homemade sausage .. So good. My husband had the meatball which he said was very tasty. The bread reminded me of my grandmother's homemade bread. The food others order around us also looked delicious. We enjoyed our lunch and will definitely come again. We want to come back for dinner soon. Their dinner menu had a nice variety and their desserts looked awesome. This place is really cute. We needed a bistro like this in the Strip. You must give them a try ... Excellent new addition to the Strip. We went on a bustling Friday night. Reservations are recommended unless you sit at the bar. The food and cocktails were terrific. Very reasonably priced wines. We had cauliflower and brussel sprout appetizers. The cauliflower was wonderful, the brussels were ok (shredded like a cole slaw). Our entrees were cacia e pepe and the bronzino. Both we're delicious. Can't wait to return for breakfast. We had a family brunch, and we found the food and drinks very good, and the service excellant...\n\nWe will definitely return again! Sitting down to write a restaurant review can be tricky at the start of the new year...with the nonstop holiday eating and drinking behind us, it's not always easy to find something that truly stands out.  UNTIL...you try the breakfast sandwich and doughnuts from DiAnoia's Eatery.  When I tell you it's the BEST breakfast sandwich I've ever had, I'm not exaggerating.  I sat at the bar/counter area on a Saturday morning and was feeling a little indecisive on just how to construct my breakfast, so I left it up to my server...and he nailed it.  A slab of spicy sausage topped with a runny egg and cheese...all sandwiched between a soft, fresh brioche bun. It was perfection.  I tend to lean more towards bacon when I order breakfast, but the spices in the sausage, combined with a perfectly cooked egg (not overdone and rubbery like so many other places) could not have been better.  Balance that out with the sweetness of the Zeppole (italian doughnuts) and you are on your way to having a very very good day.  DiAnoia's is a very welcome addition to the Strip District neighborhood...but just far enough away from the craziness that it maintains the neighborhood cafe feel.  I can't wait to try out lunch and dinner as well.  Welcome to the neighborhood DiAnoia's! I only went here for breakfast, so don't know anything about the lunch or dinner service yet. You order at the counter and go sit down and someone brings out your food. It wasn't really obvious to me at first how things worked though. It's a really small menu, only a few things. I went with a breakfast sandwich and a cappuccino. \n\nI thought that it seemed a little pricy just for what I ordered, but once the food came, I changed my mind. My sandwich was huge. It had prosciutto, egg and cheese and came on a hot buttery bun. It was so tasty. I never think about using prosciutto for breakfast sandwiches, but it tastes so much better than just bacon. I loved the coffee too.Definitely want to grab some more fo that. I'm in the strip a few times per week for coffee and something quick for breakfast. Decided to try a new place. This was  several weeks ago when DiAnoia's had just opened.  Asked for a coffee that was 1/2 decaff, half regular but they 'don't do decaff' so the coffee option was out.  Ordered a breakfast sammich, while waiting a number of staff walked by me, no one even made eye contact, not very friendly for just opening.  Took my sammich to go, had to head to the suburbs for work.  Took a bit while still parked and an uncooked yolk exploded inside my SUV.  Never had a breakfast sammich to go like that.  Promptly cleaned up  and ditched the food, headed to my usual spot down the street.  May try them again, but I'm  in no hurry. Store is clean and well stocked. They do a large volume so the fish is fresh. Fish monger will fix your fish as you like. I use this store as a grocery store because I live in the neighborhood. Meat and produce are good. Nice staff Why would you bake yourself?  I purchased several packages of cookies for the holidays.  They were all tender, delicious, and tasted just like homemade!  Don't be afraid!  No one knew I myself didn't produce these great cookies in my very own kitchen.  Each one tasted as it should.  Thy must use very good quality ingredients, chocolate, lemon, raspberry jam, etc.  the baking process must be closely watched, each was tender, moist, Cheney as it should be.  A real winner of a bakery in Pittsburgh Strip District on Penn Ave.  they gave pet treats, too! I needed to update my review, after coming to Lotus 4+ times in the past month. I am now officially OBSESSED with this place. \n\nYes, Lotus is great for specific and hard to find Asian food items like dark soy sauce, sesame oil, chili paste and dumpling wrappers- but they are also great for other things as well.\n\nProduce- Lotus has some of the freshest and cheapest produce around. You can't beat their prices on bok choy, and they have about 4-5 different types to choose from! Their scallions, peppers, eggplant and chives are also VERY affordable. I also love their selection of mushrooms- from shiitake to oyster to enoki mushrooms- they have it all. Their Japanese yams are WAY cheaper here than at Whole foods. They sell onions and lemons and limes individually, and they have thai basil which you can't find any where else! Chinese broccoli, snap/snow peas.. the list goes on and on and they are ALL affordable. They don't have a huge organic selection, but they do have some organic mushrooms. \n\nSpices- Lotus has AMAZING prices on spices. From whole fennel seeds to bay leaves to sesame seeds to whole cinnamon sticks- they have a pretty large selection throughout the entire store. Their cinnamon sticks are the cheapest I have ever seen- 5 of them for under $1.00. They sell fresh tumeric and fresh ginger here- again, wayyy cheaper than Whole Foods or Giant Eagle. They have fresh cilantro and again- their chives are VERY cheap and you get a TON of them in a package.  Even if you don't live Asian food, I would recommend coming here for the spices alone. You will be surprised. \n\nKitchen supplies- Chopsticks, bamboo sticks, cheesecloth, wooden spatulas, strainers, bowls... they have SUCH an amazing selection of cheap but good quality kitchen supplies. I was looking for thick bamboo sticks for an appetizer I was making for Christmas and went on Amazon first to look. I found a pack of 100 for about $7. I thought that wasn't a bad price. I didn't purchase them, since I figured I would just check around at Lotus first and I found a pack of 100 for $.50.... 50 CENTS! Are you kidding? I couldn't believe it. I bought a little skimmer for taking fried foods out of hot oil- under $3 for a good sized one. I then went a block or two down to the kitchen store in the strip and saw the same size skimmer for over $20... insanity. \n\nFun snacks- macadamia nut cookies- $2.50, little cookies that look like burgers and are insanely delicious and fun to eat- $2.00, pocky, gummy candy.. they have a great selection of unique and fun snacks. They are all VERY affordable too.\n\nOther amazing items to try when you visit- the dark soy sauce is life changing. It's sweeter and more thicker than traditional soy sauce and is a real treat. They make their own tofu- it's the freshest around and is only 35 CENTS A BLOCK. It's unbelievably good, too. Their dumpling wrappers are in the freezer section and are under $2 for over 60 wrappers- SO cheap and SO easy to make delicious and fun food with them. They are a steal. You can't beat their prices for sushi rice ($2 for 1 lb.), sushi nori (about $2) and the mat to make the sushi with was under $2 as well. They have a great tea selection and if you are into seafood, they have a HUGE seafood selection. They have a great noodle selection and their ramen noodles are delicious. The one thing I was a little disappointed in is there selection of kimchi- they only had 1 kind to choose from the last couple of times that I visited.\n\nThis place is AMAZING and I highly suggest that you think about it not only when you are buying your specific Asian food items, but for your casual grocery shopping as well. You will not be disappointed. Went to The Harp last night with a small group to grab a few beers and listen to Mark Guiser. Mark didn't disappoint and got the small crowd going with some of our favorite Irish songs. Wednesdays they have Guinness and wings specials. Great place to go during the week since it usually isn't crowded and to listen to some good music. This place deserves every star I gave it ! Food is really good especially the cheese fries ! This is a small little Asian grocer at the north end of the strip. We stumbled upon it when we were strolling around. They have lots of sauce selection and dry goods. They don't have a lot of fresh produce but they do have some fresh herbs. The lady in the store is quite nice and helpful. I didn't realize they have lunch offerings but would be happy to try next time! Great food! We had the best waitress named Laurie(that is how I believe it is spelled) and she was marvelous! Great all around. Stayed at the Homewood next door to Lidia's and decided to try it out on a rainy Monday evening after the holidays. Interior of the restaurant is gorgeous. Very unique chandeliers and posh looking. Our review may be impacted by the fact that we had a long day of travelling and had many snacks so we were not ravenous upon arrival. For that reason, we did not order any appetizers. \n\nThe bread basket was fairly good and the dipping sauces (pesto, oil, and a white bean dip) were good. The bread sticks especially had a great cheese flavor. One thing that struck me about this establishment was the amount of staff that they had. Two people (perhaps one was shadowing the other as a new hire?) to deliver the bread, a waitress, and another person who delivered our dinner. All were attentive and friendly. If this review was strictly for service it would be 5 stars.\n\nI shared the chicken parm with my daughter. It was lackluster to say the least. I do not recall what the menu stated, but as served this was a piece of essentially fried chicken, with some chunks of tomato and bland unseasoned broccoli served on the side. No pasta. No melted cheese on top of the chicken. \n\nDH ordered the heritage pork with a side of brussels sprouts with pancetta. He reported that the pork was fair to middling but the brussel's were the real star of the show. I did try one and would have to agree. If we ever came back here we would probably just order several plates of brussels, but the likelihood of our returning here is pretty small.\n\nWe did see another table with the fresh pasta (final prep done tableside) and that did look delicious. ***Over priced and under seasoned*** I still can't believe that we actually had a bad meal in Pittsburgh, especially at this establishment.\n\nThis restaurant has been on our list for quite some time, and with restaurant week we finally decided to try something in a different part of town. What a disappointment. The service was average, but the dishes themselves were so incredibly bland that it was like we ate nothing. I ordered the chicken with mushrooms, grana padano, tomatoes, spinach, and garlic-the only thing I actually tasted in that dish was the spinach, and there was way too much of it. My husband ordered the roasted cod al Matalotta with grilled polenta-the only thing he could taste was polenta. He couldn't even finish half of his dish (which is unheard of), and we regret that we even took home the leftovers. Even more telling, the table next to us sent some of their dishes back.\n\nBottom line--although the ambiance and the location was nice, I do not recommend this place. Dined here over the weekend- one of the best Italian restaurants I've been to. I loved the lamb shank. It was so good! Although very pricy, I recommend this restaurant to anyone who enjoys foods of different cultures. Nice to bring ur boo then turn up ... great menu Great atmosphere so check this place out my yelpers.... Wonderful hole in the wall. Small and cozy little place.  Owners were great, very nice and helpful they were also very polite and kept my water glass full. Pho was very tasty, and full of flavor.  They gave enough side veggies to be acceptable the only downside is that I didn't see any fish sauce on the tables.  The price wasn't bad, less than ten dollars for the brisket ph\u00f3. I've had it for less in other cities but it's the first time in PA. Next time I'm in PA I will definitely be back. Two thumbs up, only because I only have two. I don't know the whole story behind this sushi place merging with Vietnam Pho, outside of there being construction in the old building. I didn't see any of the owners that were at Vietnam's, so who knows?\n\nI used to always take a trip to Vietnam's for their consistency in their pho and since we saw Maiku does sushi and pho it worked out that I wanted pho and my husband wanted sushi, until we got there.\n\nAtmosphere:\nSo a few things, it is very small in there. So if you like a little bit of elbow room or don't want to essentially be sitting right next to other patrons, then maybe take a drive to Squirrel Hill or down the street to Pho Van. There is also not much seating, so if you have a lot of people, it may not be the best place. There were two semi large groups when we arrived and we thankfully were able to find an unused chair to grab it for our table. Outside of these, it's very basic inside, nothing fancy, which is perfectly fine for me.\n\nService:\nThe service definitely depended on who walked by you. The older woman initially is the one who sat us and was very pleasant. Our server, was the younger woman, who was very quiet (as in, we couldn't really hear her). We were handed our menus and finally figured out what we wanted and were ready to place our order. At that time, is when she finally told us they weren't serving sushi. This information would have been super helpful when you handed us the menus and asked for our drink orders! Especially considering their menu is half sushi. Our waters took a long time to be refilled. And my appetizer was brought out AFTER my main dish. So, I wasn't overall pleased with the service considering some serving basics were lacking.\n\nFood:\nFood was 50/50 for me, so I will break it down by what we ordered.\nFresh Spring Rolls: These were lacking for me. They were very poorly made. As in, they were almost falling apart when they came to the table. They were also brought after my main dish which I found slightly odd considering they're also a sushi place. So, my assumption is, they're good with making rolls, considering they roll sushi. But apparently not so much. The lettuce was chopped much too thin and they just lacked freshness and flavor that you typically get from green onion and now that I think about, I think mine were missing the pork.\n\nPho: Their pho was decent as usual (I always order Pho Dac Biet). The broth was a bit peppery though. Someone definitely added quite a bit of black pepper to the broth. It could have been a touch beefier, but that's ok. Once I added in my toppings and things, it worked for me. Unrelated to the pho itself, but the bowl it was served in wasn't the greatest. The edges curved outward, which was sorta annoying when mixing up your pho a bit because broth would go over the curved edge.\n\nCom Dia: My husband ordered Com suon-bi and his dish looked pretty tasty and looked pretty consistent from Vietnam's when I've seen others order it. I tried his pork and it was spot on and very tasty.\n\nBubble Tea: We used to enjoy going to Vietnam's for their good bubble tea selection. They still serve bubble tea here but, the tapioca balls were not good. They almost tasted stale? I ordered a Thai Tea bubble tea and my Thai Tea was perfect so I drank that and left all my tapioca balls at the bottom. My husband agreed that the tapioca balls tasted off.\n\nBanh Mi: We ordered two banh mi's to go for dinner. Just say no. They were not good and not very authentically made. The bread was far too thick and sorta tough. They add cheap lunch meat to it which makes it extremely salty and just not good. Their pate is far too runny. Quite honestly, you can get a decent banh mi at the Oriental Grocery in McKnight for cheaper than here and with better ingredients.\n\n-------------\nWould I go back now? Honestly, probably not. Considering there are other pho locations that are just as good, I will probably go to those. I can't speak to their sushi, which may be great, but this visit has me not really wanting to go back. Vietnam Pho meets Maiku Sushi in an all-out merge of Asian cuisine.  We went here on New Year's Eve, Pho-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la!  Confusion set in as I approached the building... Where is Vietnam Pho?  Pho napped????  We enter, much, much smaller than their last venue.  We were quickly greeted by a waitress who I immediately questioned regarding the name and location.  She assured me Vietnam Pho now aptly named Maiku Sushi & Vietnam Pho had moved to this much smaller front next door and were still the same but offering sushi as well.  Relief set in.  \n\nThis new space only has about 10-12 small tables.  We were the only ones in here at the time minus what appeared to be an extended family enjoying some end of the year noodles.  Think Christmas Story.   We were disappointed to learn that though they now offer sushi, they were not offering it that night, nor were they offering any Banh mi.  Bummer on the sandwich part, but pho was the real reason I was there so I pho-got about it quick. See what I just did there???     \n\nWe ordered Goi Cuon (2 to an order) spring rolls with shrimp, pork, vermicelli and fresh vegetables rolled in rice paper.  They were served with a nice peanut sauce.  Very tasty, could have ordered a couple more, but had to save some room.  I went with the Pho Dac Beit, the queen-mother of all Pho.  They served it up nice and piping hot, with lots of additional fixings per my request.  Smiles in my tummy.  The broth was tasty, but not over powering as to assume a ton of salt or God forbid MSG was added.  The noodles were plentiful, and cooked nicely.  The tendon and tripe were not rubbery as some places tend to serve them.  This was a good looking bowl of food, dressed well under my layers of toppings.  The price isn't terrible either, about in line with the rest of the Pho restaurants in town.  We also had leftovers.  I recommend having them box leftovers.  I tried and miserably failed pouring broth all over myself the table, floor, you get the picture.  \n\nI have to say, though I can't really recall if this was the case at the last location, they only have a basement bathroom.  This is quite popular in Pittsburgh, but if you are handicap or in my case recovering from knee surgery it is really difficult to maneuver the steps.  Not only is the ceiling way low but the steps are deep.  I thought I would have taken a tumble a couple of times. \n\nGreat way to end 2016, looking forward to some 2017 Pho-sho. We had been planning to try this place out a few times before but something always came up and we didn't' get to the Strip for some Pho in time.  Finally on New Years Eve we made it here and got to try their Pho out.\n\n     I had never had pho before but I've seen my wife eat it a few times before.  It always looked and smelled good but I always found something else to try.  Being that it was New Years Eve they had a limited menu so my real only choice was Pho!  No problem because I wants to try it and now I had to.\n \n     I didn't go crazy so I just ordered their chicken noodle pho.  I knew I couldn't go wrong with that.  I really liked the pho.  The broth, noodles, and chicken went really well together.  I even did a good job eating with chop sticks.  Ok stop laughing at me...\n\n     My only complaint would be that it needed more noodles, chicken, and more veggies to add to my pho.  There was just a little too much broth but it still was really good and filling for me.  \n Looking at the menu if I didn't' order pho I would try out one of their Bahn Mi's.  I am a pho fan now and I will consider getting another type of pho other than chicken noodle pho next time.\n\n     As far as this restaurant it is small.  So it's probably good for take out for us next time.  I work close by and I can see my wife asking me to bring some home after work.  The waitress that we had was nice and their service was really good overall.  \n\n     This is a nice and small restaurant.  If you're in the Strip and you're looking for a warm, filling lunch/dinner stop buy or order take out.  You will be satisfied in your tummy and wallet. I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND BUBBLE TEA HERE. I had spicy california roll thai bubble tea. The roll was ok, and good value for such affordable price but the bubble tea is horrible, hard bubble and sugary milk tea. I've been coming here for YEARS!!! Without question it is the BEST sushi in the city...Andy's is at the source for seafood in Pittsburgh, it gets NO better. Andy, too, is like dinner and a show. He's engaging, funny and a master craftsman. Anyone else in the city who says they have the best sushi is frankly, well, let's just say they don't know the truth. Sushi? Andy's. Great food. Meat Meat and Meat what's not to love. The staff was very friendly and helpful as the menu is overwhelming for a first timer. I would go back again anytime I return to Pittsburgh. I only wish I would have know it was BYOB. This place deserves all of the hype.  I have been here three times and I am still enchanted.  Both their pork and their chicken are unbelievable.  They even make the toast noteworthy.  Be prepared to stand in line, as you won't order until they have a table ready for you.  You can expect at least a 45 minute wait if you line up outside.  They are BYOB, and sometimes they even hand out glasses and openers before you get to your table.  Yum! The meat choices perfect, busy place, very good flavour s.but what threw me off a little bit was the char the meat.the pulled pork was absolutely perfect and the chicken wings were Really good.i could do with a tad spicier but if I were to go again these would be the dishes I d order Service is absolutely AWFUL. My roommate and I went with our mothers and we are 20 & 21. We told our order several times at the front (keep in mind the line was non existent, so they weren't rushed or busy). They were so distracted by my roommates real ID that they forgot half of our order. They seemed very suspicious of her ID even though it was real and she was with her mother. Then we got four wine glasses at the table, and the woman came over again and asked to see our IDs when I clearly was not drinking. Best part, they asked us to leave immediately after we finished because there was a short line. No one else around us was asked to leave, and there were people who were there longer than us. Good food, but absolutely not acceptable behavior. I work in the restaurant business and that is the first rule, you cannot ask people to leave. I do not recommend. Now, everyone talks about this place. Your mom, your cousin, daddy, step father, sister, cousin...everyone. I certainly didn't want to try it out because of all of the hype. Well, the hype is warranted! This place is everything! I mean everything. Like the moon and the stars type of everything.\n\nI arrived around 11:30 am on a Friday. It was a good thing that I did because the lunch crowd appeared at about 11:40. Once you arrive, you stand in line, and on the wall is a large chalkboard menu. You order at the front, pay and then you are seated. Someone then, brings your order to the seating area, and yells your name. They then bring your dish to your table. \n\nI got the Carne sandwich with rib eye and a side house salad. The sandwich was so big and scrumptious. I literally, drooled on the table when I opened it up (the sandwiches come in that sandwich paper). I should have known it would be good, the paper it was wrapped in was so greasy. The meat was so tender, and the onions, the caramelized onions leave nothing to be desired. The house salad was a perfect size, and I believe they make their own dressing. It was peppery and tangy. \n\nI loved my experience here. The service was quick, the place was clean, and the staff was polite. It was a great place to celebrate the end of the work week! Food is great.  Service was good. Not a fan of the location.  Not a place to take a date if you want to hear her speak.  Order ahead and take the food home This place is so good.  Having spent 6 months in Argentina, I  do love a good parrilla (w/ bomb chimichurri!) and this is legit. And BYOB! However, the timing is key, since there are no reservations and the line can be insane.  When they do the basement chef's tasting menu, you can reserve in advance, and skip the line (worth it!). Food was good, but since you order at a counter, you don't have a server, but someone will bring your food. Don't go expecting to sit, relax, dine, and talk with friends. They will start clearing around you. It's all about turning the tables. This is hands-down, the best restaurant in Pittsburgh. I think about going there whenever I am hungry. The meat is unparalleled, the brussels sprouts are a favorite, but seriously, there is nothing they do not do well, I believe. My mouth is watering even writing this. Excellent!\nLoooong lines, so have a small snack if you need to wait, but stick it out, because it is so worth it. Definitely one of the best Restaurants in Pittsburgh. Quality is consistent. Also extremely friendly and eclectic staff. The boy with the pink hair was really cute and nice. Great place for lunch or to take the fam to in the early evening. After hearing all of the hype about Gaucho Parrilla, I decided to finally check it out after months of wanting to go. There was a group of six of us that decided to go on a Wednesday evening at 7pm. The line was out the door and down the street when we got there (and it was pretty cold out!) We waited in line for a total of about an hour before we ended up ordering our food and getting a table. The staff was very nice and when we got through the door, they offered to get open our wine for us and get us wine glasses while we waited. Gaucho is BYOB with no corkage fee, which is a huge plus. The six of us brought a total of four bottles of wine to split between us.  I ordered  the large Provoletta as an appetizer. My fianc\u00e9 and I decided to split our meals, so I ordered the large Cordero (lamb) and the large Bire de Chorizo (NY strip) for us. Both were cooked perfectly! I loved all of the flavors! Make sure to try all of the sauces that they have. They compliment the meal perfectly. I have no complaints at all about Gaucho, and I would highly recommend visiting, even if it includes having to wait outside in the cold in line! Gaucho definitely lived up to all the hype and I will be returning in the future! Good food. Meat is greta with a lot of variety. Sometimes the char is too much.  Get there early before the line goes out the door and up the bridge. Very few businesses deliver the highest quality again and again without fail. Even the best have an off night. After a couple dozen visits and recommending Gaucho dozens of times, it has never failed to deliver a fantastic meal! The restaurant itself is nothing spectacular and everyone serves and seats themselves, but that adds to the experience and serves to keep costs low. It's all about the high-quality and expertly-prepared food. You MUST try all four different sauces, however. Each one is great in it's own way, although my favorite is the garlic, which goes well with anything. Jose is hilarious and keeps everything light and everyone smiling. I could not recommend a casual dining experience any more. The lone significant drawback is the long line and moderate wait during lunch and dinner rushes on most days. Gaucho Parrilla Argentina is one of the absolute best restaurants I've ever had the pleasure of eating at. This is our go to place and is well worth waiting in line to get in. The food quality is always superb and the service is always friendly and fun. They do a great job of keeping the food consistent every time and keeping the quality very high even though they are always swamped. \n\nThe rosemary braised beef is one of my favorites and always has a delicious wood fired taste with great caramelized onions, a delicious horseradish sauce and homemade bun. I like to put their AJO sauce on it for an extra bite. \n\nThe provoletta dish of melted provolone cheese on top of house made bread with an assortment of olives and arugula is also a delicious side to any meal and their wood roasted corn is to die for!\n\nWhen I first moved back home to Pittsburgh after an extended stay in Florida the first place we went on the way home from the airport was Gaucho. i come here every weekend with my firends and it only gets better and better . I have various food allergies and experienced nothing but the best at Gaucho! I was informed that Gaucho uses 100% olive and corn oils (no blends) and no butter or milk (at least in what I ordered). I had the sweet potato mash, mushrooms, avo salad, and tried some of the steak burger. Very friendly service and cool atmosphere. Definitely recommend. We came here for a pre-show dinner.  The different breads were probably my favorite part--not just Italian, but different sweet breads too.  I felt that the waiters were trained to be a little pretentious--frequently saying \"pardon my reach.\"  Otherwise, good food, and they got us to our show on time. Quite possibly my new favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. Unable to decide on a particular entr\u00e9e, we (party of two) decided to split everything we ordered. For the first course, Jumbo Lump Crab Cake and Berkshire Prosciutto. Main Entr\u00e9e, Beef Tenderloin. Wine, bottle of 2014 Duckhorn Decoy Red Blend Bordeaux. And dessert, Cr\u00e8me Fra\u00eeche Br\u00fbl\u00e9e. All were otherworldly!!! Also, the ambiance for a party of two is very intimate. We made a 10:30PM reservation and, for the majority of our visit, we were the only two individuals in the dining area of the restaurant. Despite the late arrival, the staff was spectacular and more than accommodating!!  Can't wait to go back and try some of the other menu items!! We visited there in the New Year's Eve. There was a Chef's Special Menu for that evening. Everything we ordered was wonderful, and so as the service. The total expensive is $100 for two. Considering we have 4 dishes and two deserts, it's not expensive at all. I will definitely go there for the next time. Awesome bread, awesome oysters, awesome wine list and excellent bar drinks. Service was great. Would visit more often if I had more money (quite expensive). Worth the hype. Unfortunately, they don't offer tasting menus anymore, but I was pleased by the variety on their menu this weekend. Everything about the restaurant was impeccable, from the food to the service to the ambiance.\n\nWe ordered two appetizers - the raw tuna and the scallops. I loved the scallops - and I order scallops at any place that has them on the menu, so I like to think that I know what's good :) The accompaniments to both appetizers were balanced and well done. For our entrees, I don't even remember what we ordered - my boyfriend got some chicken dish, and I got the fish. Both were very good - the usual balanced, delicate flavors and varied textures. \n\nDessert was divine and deserves its own shout-out. The banana cream pie was unique and light, while the creme fraiche creme brulee was more \"normal\" but still an elevated kind of average. This review is for the prix fixe brunch, $29 for a cocktail, appetizer and entree. It's a great deal, and everything I've sampled has been delicious. The Bloody Mary is actually spicy which is appreciated. This time I got the oysters (6 pieces) and the steak and eggs. My friend got the short rib hash and bacon burger. We were both satisfied with the portions and the food. I like the variety they have on the menu, especially if you didn't want to pick between a sweet and savory brunch you could get one of each! Will definitely be back. I am not sure how the majority of stars is 5 on this restaurant.  If I could give it 0 stars I would.  We got a table upstairs and our waitress Megan came over.  She had 0 personality and you can tell she just wanted to keep making the check more expensive so her tip would be higher.  She didn't even introduce herself, we only knew her name because it said it on the check.  If you are a waitress at a high class restaurant like that one I expect better service.  I ordered the hanger steak and my husband ordered the tagliatelle.  As we waited we were given one slice of bread each.  Was good, but we wanted more because it was so small as if it was a sample.  Our food came, first impression of my hanger steak was this is so small.  Honestly, my hanger steak should of been on the appetizer list, that's how small it was.  My husbands first impression of his tagliatelle was it smelled like semen.  No, I am not trying to be funny it 100% smelt like semen.  I don't know why he tried a bite but he did.  He couldn't eat it, from the smell.  Is this place special sauce semen or something?  Honestly, I don't know how no one has ever said something about it.  My poor husband was sick afterwards, I had to go home and make him and I something to eat. Since his smelt like semen and mine was so small I was still hungry. Never again will I go to this restaurant.  IF YOU HAVE A BIG BURRITO GROUP COUPON GO TO CASBAH 100X BETTER. Yes! Just go and check it out. My favorite foods are simple, yet expertly prepared. These folks know how to make authentic tacos and they are delicious. we had the chicken and pork and both were fantastic. I would give them 5 stars if they started making their own tortillas or at least bought from a small place versus the bagged Mission brand... in any event, we'll be back! I went with my husband and we loved everything there, specially the tostones! Sooo good!!! When I'm in the Strip District, Prestogeorge is always on my list of must-visit shops. When you walk in you are greeted with the smiling faces of all of the friendly employees and the aroma of freshly roasted coffee. You can order hot or cold coffee or tea drinks or some small lunch items like wraps and sandwiches. My main attraction here, though, is the loose tea collection.\n\nI'm a huge tea drinker and I have little white paper bags of Presto teas all over my kitchen. Their loose teas are extremely fairly priced, and they have a variety that would even leave the pickiest tea drinker with something he or she was excited to try. A couple of my favorites have been the blackberry sage black tea, the Japanese tea garden green tea, and the Temple of Heaven gunpowder green tea. They have brewing supplies as well as an extensive selection of coffees, which I'm sure are all lovely, but I usually stick to tea as it's always been my preference. Next time you're in the strip and looking for some herbal love or an afternoon pick-me-up, Prestogeorge is the place to go! Still my favorite coffee shop in the entire city!  Only downfall is that they are not open on Sundays, but I can't even be mad that they give their employees Sundays off!  My favorite latte is the Milky Way. Always order a large.... And the baristas make it quickly and oh so delicious!  I need to venture away from the door and the coffee station and check out the rest of the place. It always smells delicious in there when I walk in. The staff is very friendly and efficient. Love love love this place!!! Kaya is out of place in Pittsburgh. It's kind of a funky, big city restaurant, with a Caribbean, African flavor. The food is top shelf, but not your meat and potatoes style, with some spice and unusual preparations and a limited menu. If you can accept all of that you'll like this place, particularly if you enjoy a good drink, since the happy hour is one of the best around. Service is professional, and the room is a little loud, but appropriately so. \n\nOur dinner tonight was just the fish tacos, which were great, and lots of alcohol, as usual. I can't think of any areas for improvement, and am real happy to eat here when the opportunity arises. It's small and crowded, so reservations are recommended. I went here for an interview dinner, and it was a great choice! The atmosphere takes you away from what was a very cold and dreary Pittsburgh day to cool breezy Jamaica with the reggae tunes and warm decor. The server was mature and seasoned. She was around just enough and made sure we had everything we needed. The menu has a mix of Latin and Caribbean influences with some pretty great vegan and vege options. We ordered the corn and lentil beignets which were so dang tasty! Others had the jerk wings and the chips and cheese dip which they destroyed. Haha. I ordered the grilled salmon which also did not disappoint. And for dessert, I had the bread pudding with vanilla ice cream added on top. The ice cream sealed the deal for me-- it was the perfect complement to the warm banana chocolate bread pudding (Which really didn't have bananas in it lol, but still pretty tasty). I will be returning next time I'm in Pittsburgh! Excellent place to stop by. \nSophia at the bar is a gem. She will take care of you with minimum of fuss. I have a lot more respect for bartenders after being served by her. \nThis is an awesome restaurant. They have over 15 beers on tap and also bottles for a reasonable price. \nThis should be rated $$ on yelp \nStarted out with plantain and mixed chips. \nI cannot say enough things about this place!! if you're in the area I would recommend this place. My first time here I was very surprised . . . We came here on a busy day but still got a seat in a timely manner. They have a machine so the orange juice is always fresh. Our waitress was very polite. Our food didn't take long to get to us & even if I did have to wait a little long. . .The wait would be worth it. Wow what a place. Prob the best breakfast I've ever had. Sausage gravy was on point. The home fries were the best I've ever had hands down and the coffee was on point. Brother had French toast and he thought it was the best he ever had. Might make the 5 hr drive back just for breakfast sometime I'm ashamed of myself for not eating here til today. I got the bacon, home fries, eggs over easy and rye - the prototypical breakfast. Everything was fresh, the bacon delicious, potatoes filling and crispy, and giant eye bread toasted to perfection. Will certainly come back for more! Freaking awesome highly recommend the OMG. Loved the hit sausage!  Friendly old time atmosphere. Spice heaven. You would not be upset if this was where you ended up in the afterlife. While you still have breath in your body, you must experience the scents and the seasoning. The palette requires a bit of exuberant indulgence and this place comes with that and more. Love to cook or know someone that does? If so Penzeys is the place to go and check out! They literally have every kind of extract, dry rub, salt, seasoning or spice you could ever want or need. Their prices are higher than say McCormick at Giant Eagle but, the quality of the ingredients are second to none.\n\nEvery time we've gone the staff has always been friendly and eager to answer any questions we've had about spices and what foods to pair them with. \n\nMost items are available in five different sizes: glass jars of 1/4 or 1/2 cup or bags of 4, 8, or 16oz. One of my families favorite seasonings is the Sandwich Sprinkle. It is excellent on Italian Hoagies. \n\nThey also have seasons that pair perfectly with beef or pork. They even have different vanilla beans and cinnamons and cocoa powder. \n\nTheir BBQ 3000 seasoning is perfect for anyone who loves to grill like I do. Be sure to sign up for the free monthly Penzeys as it features recipes and coupons for free spices or seasonings.\n\nIf you're not sure where to start Penzeys even has premade gift sets to get you started. If you're ever down in the Strip District Penzeys is a must stop. Great pepperoni pizza.  Large slice, small price.  Attentive service, love the smell of the ovens !  Doesn't get much better in the burgh.  Been there alone, or with friends or family. Predictably good every time. So thankful that we finally stopped in. I had sampled their wine before at yelp events and always wanted to visit. I decided that this is where I wanted to go on my birthday. \n\nThe young lady helping us was very kind, personable and knew the wines. We sampled a few each. I tried Malbec, 2014 Cabernet & Red Blend. My boyfriend tried the Cabernet Reserve and another one that I'm unsure of.\n\n The Malbec was very good. It had a spice to it but it was still smooth. Red Blend was also good.. Basic but again very smooth. \n\nWe each decided on a glass of 2014 Cabernet and headed downstairs to the basement. It felt so warm and inviting. We arrived about 40 minutes Before closing and only had a good 25 minutes downstairs. Next time ill be sure to allow more time. I didn't want to leave! It would also be cool to bring in food to enjoy your wine with also \n\n\nWe plan on being regulars here. The experience was fun and the relaxation we felt in the basement was priceless. Theres so many good things about this place.I came here with my husband and the customer service was awesome. she recommended me to the best wines ive ever tasted and made my visit very comfortable for me We're from the south and this place has one of the best po boys we've had. The atmosphere was fun and I'm sure in the spring and summer it's even better, there are 2 big clear garage type doors in the front that look like they can be opened. Our waiter was great. Our glasses were never empty, he stayed on top of bringing us refills even before we asked for them. I would definitely go back. None finer.  Excellent coffee, service, atmosphere. I go early in am, no trouble parking.  Quick, friendly service.  Priced just right too. No 'barista-hipster' attitude. Black in the hat here. I'm not a food reviewer just a dude who randomly like to try foods. Sooooooooooo BACK STORY!!! I first had Pho in Chinatown in Montreal it was cold outside (duh Canada weather) and I told my friend that I just wanted something quick that will keep me warm and fill me up. So we walk into this little shop and I have him order me the beef pho, because I don't speak any language besides Pittsbughese but I'm working on it. \n\nAnyway this Pho reminded me of that cold day in Montreal, warm full of flavor and spicy!! I have only had at one other place in Pittsburgh, down the street from this place. But this Pho was more flavorful to me, even tho the other place was cheaper. \n\nFINAL Grade: I grade on a scale of \"Naw Son\" to \"You got to try this\" \n\nPho Van: Get it, Get it A solid place to get your caffeine fix. They have a large variety of beans ranging from regular roasted to exotically flavored (decaf too!). The large barrels are easy to scoop your coffee out of, and you can even combine flavors (cinnamon and vanilla is a favorite of mine). They have grinders on site as well, so you can either take home whole beans or have them ground in-store. They have a large supply of french presses and tumblers available as well. The large selection and reasonable prices are why this place gets 5/5. Went there about a month ago and they had an awesome lunch special it came to $8.00 but was deff worth it ! The breakfast we had was pretty yummy. I had no complaints. The menu was large considering they are not open most of the day. Parking can be a pain. However, if you are in the Strip District, you will like this place. It has a great deal of history. Many people in the area have frequented that diner. Even famous celebrities have eaten at the joint while filming. You will find this to be a trip down memory lane. The place is sort of frozen in time. Somehow the ancient feel works for the space. Visiting from California to beautiful Pittsburg for the Steelers game.  Was told by all the locals that this is a must go to place for breakfast if we visiting in town.  Got there  and the wait was about 5 minutes (we got lucky) and all I can say is this place is one of the best breakfast places my wife and I have ever eaten at. I had the friend chicken and waffle with a side of potatoes and my wife had a waffle with some ham.  Simply amazing and the service was very good.  \n\nIf you visiting Pittsburg, this place is a must go to!!!!!!  We honestly liked it better than Pamela's. Fun spot to people watch activities on the strip and people watch people inside the diner. Great greasy spoon right on the strip. The french toast made with Mancini's raisin bread was really good. DH had omelette with chorizo and reports that it was pretty spicy. Homefries, which we requested to be extra crispy, were perfect. Haven't been here in a long time and we looked forward to visiting this establishment today since we drove to Pittsburgh to visit family.  Very disappointed! Prices went up, cash only, owner/Manager very rude! Had to ask for coffee refill twice! Overall breakfast was good and plenty of it too! Hostess very friendly. We won't be visiting this establishment anytime soon! I rather revisit Door Stop in  Dormont or Bobs in Carnegie! Adios DeLucas! We let the bartender design out drinks based on our preferences, and I had a delicious seasonal fall drink.  My meal was pretty good, but my boyfriend was not quiet as impressed.  The drinks were actually more memorable than the food.  I like the atmosphere--very in sync with the strip. I never made it to brunch, which I regret.  Fun place. Cool idea, food is pricey and get be hit or miss, sometimes great sometimes average, drinks well done and lots of room at bar (usually) I have been to Smallman Galley a few times and have had an amazing meal each time! It never disappoints. My boyfriend loves the burger place the best, but I am impartial as they all are amazing! We enjoy taking people here who are picky eaters, or if we aren't really sure what we're all in the mood for - as the variety is pretty vast. The concept is wonderful, the food is great, the people are nice, it's just wonderful. The only downside is that seating is first come first serve and can sometimes be hard to find, but all in all it's a great, unique place to dine. Think fast food meets fine dining. I have been here 3 times, always sharing plates with different people, and I have never had a bad dish.  The concept is interesting, reminiscent of Krog Street Market in Atlanta, on a smaller scale.  I most recently had the sweat and sour pork Banh Mi from Provision--yum!!  Though Provision changed up the traditional sandwich, I was not upset for the change.  It came with a generous salad.  I also have loved the squash grilled cheese from Provision's neighbor-also delicious.  People have loved the avocado toast.  Great place. How anyone could not give this place 5 stars blows my mind.  I went here with my wife and two friends for a late second lunch on Saturday.  Let me start by saying that the concept is great.  It's basically a mall foodcourt for foodies (with stiff cocktails and reclaimed wooden tables standard!).  \n\nEverything I ate here was excellent. My main dish was a fried asian rice with sausage and eggs mixed in; so so so good.  As was the pork belly ramen.  Will definitely go back the next time I'm in Pittsburgh! Love the concept behind Smallman Gallery, lots of talented local cooks creating a wide variety of brunch options at a reasonable price. We stopped into two of the local shops and got a egg & tomato based scramble and a brie and mushroom omelette, both of which were excellent. Will definitely be back again to try out more! I was intrigued when I first heard the concept of this place. For those who don't know, this joint is a cooking experiment of sorts for new or not-as-well-known chefs to get a place to advertise their restaurant concepts with 18-month stints. As such, I decided to go one day and try this place. Currently, there are four restaurants nested within this place: Aubergine Bistro (mixed cuisines), Carota Cafe (veggies-inspired), Josephine's Toast (breakfast-based), and Provision Pgh Food + Drink (meat + global-inspired cuisine). If you're interested in learning more about what each place is about and what their menu lineup is, I suggest you Google Smallman Galley and see what this place is all about. In terms of how it works, just like going to any other restaurant. You pick a certain one (or however many you like to try), order and pay at the register. The eating area is cafeteria-style that is located in the back past the four restaurant concepts. If you're eating in, I believe they bring your food to you when it's ready. In general, you can't really go wrong with any of these places and it's a great way to support those who are up and coming in the food scene. Go check this place out! Love the concept!  Great atmosphere and good selection of craft beer but the food was served ICE COLD!  Our restaurant choice was Josephine's Toast. I really like Smallman Galley.  It's such a great place to go and get GOOD food with a group of people, especially if everyone's in the mood for something different. \n\nIt's a really awesome way to try out new food and cuisine that doesn't break the bank.  I love the laidback atmosphere.  Last week I had this amazing carrot butternut soup (I think that's what it was called!) and bread for $7. My friend's ordered heftier meals and we were all satisfied.  I like that ability to get what you want and not be tied down to a specific menu.\n\nI've been here twice and food has been excellent both times.  Friends got different assortments of items and everyone enjoyed their meal.  Definitely give it a try! My favorite and go to for sushi in Pittsburgh.  I'm really picky and actually gave up sushi for my first year living in Pittsburgh because the quality of fish sort of sucks here (only really eat sushi and sashimi when I'm home in California or in NYC).  However, I had a really bad craving and finally gave Penn Ave a shot.  Worth it. So worth it. Good portions, prices were good, and service is excellent.  I also buy sashimi grade fish here whenever I want to make poke and sushi at home.  Only thing that's a bit weird is that they have lettuce in some of their rolls (and some other weird combinations)... but it's Pittsburgh, so I just accept it.  I just order it without and they'll accommodate, which is nice. Good food but horrible customer service. Went to pick it up as takeout and stood at the pay here sign and the staff kept ringing up people at the order here sign for a solid 5 minutes before anyone acknowledged me. Very unorganized. They also gave me the wrong order. Love their food but they dont seem to care about the customer at all. After many times picking up food here I am discouraged as a customer who spends a lot of money there and doesnt even get so much as a smile or acknowledged. Probably wont be ordering much more from there. Food is first rate !   Soups are great and the crabmeat tacos are to die for !   The smoked salmon cannot be beat !    So many choices !!  The employees working here are not only knowledgable but first rate friendly !!!    5 stars NO DOUBT!!   Been there about twenty times!!! His place is pretty good. People rave about the sushi, but it wasn't to die for. The fish was very fresh and the roll was good, but it just didn't blow me away. My husband got the crab melt which was pretty good. We also got oysters, but there was some sand in mine. Also they were $3 each and I was hoping since they are a fish market as well that they'd be a little cheaper. Overall it was a good experience. Overall a really cool little spot... Donuts are really good and amazing when they are still warm! Staff is also very helpful We stopped through Pittsburgh as we usually do on our way home from Michigan, and that means breakfast at P&G's followed by a trip to Presto George. The food is always good at P&G's, but I am deducting two stars for the atrocious service we got on our last visit. It was our first time dining there on a slow day - the Wednesday morning after New Year's, and there were only five occupied tables in the whole restaurant. We sat right in the middle of the room, yet were utterly ignored for almost ten minutes, and another couple that sat well after us was visited first. Then the server screwed up my girlfriend's crepe order, and the replacement was wrong also. I know that the restaurant practically prints money because it's such an institution, but it says a lot about a restaurant when they mail it in this badly on a slow day. There are a lot of other options in the Strip District; maybe we should go elsewhere next time. Excellent service, great food, nice portions, and a welcoming atmosphere! Would visit again!! This place is always so busy ! But the food is really good and the service is pretty nice . P&G Pam's Diner does not need me to tell you to eat breakfast there--I need to tell you to eat breakfast there! Whew, now I feel better. It feels good to get that off my chest, but I must tell you more. The Tex-Mex omelette was muy benito, and my guy's pancake, eggs, and bacon were very good. Is the bread homemade? Maybe! But it is delicious. Y.U.M. Came here for breakfast with my cousin the day after he had some sort of tour of the University of Pittsburgh. Overall when walking in... We were waiting in a line with a bunch of people. No one there, not even the guy standing and staring blankly at us from the front decided to tell us there was a paper wait list we had to sign in on to get seated. Not intuitive.. It was on a small sheet of paper off to the side. \n\nThen he offered us seating next to the front insisting it was better where the cold wind blew in every time the door opened (I'm not stupid, I graduated kindergarten). If I say I want to get on the list and wait, put me on the damn list..... Anyways finally got seated after wasting half an hour of my time (not to mention he skipped 2 people ahead of us in line and I called it out..!). \n\nWhen the waitress came, I asked her for recommendations and she had nothing to say... Nothing special or interesting at this place so I just ordered my food. Serving size for cost was good. Quality was \"good\" at best. Food came out quick and hot which I liked a lot. \n\nSee pictures for serving sizes. I got a hotcake and grilled cheese with a side of potatoes. Not pleased the place was really busy and they didn't have enough staff the food was good but I don't think I will be back any time soon Best Mexican food downtown. Lunch menu is smaller but we were able to order apps from dinner menu. Handmade bloody Maria's were amazing!! This is a pretty cool place. A little skeptical goin in because of the bad service reviews but we sat at the bar so the service was great. The bloody Maria mix was very good. We got the salsa sampler and the habanero salsa was extremely good. The verde was my second favorite. We both got mini tacos and the bistec and barbacoa were the best. Overall really great experience and  we will definitely be back. Initially came here for Restuarant Week but was disappointed by the menu so my group and I ordered off of their regular menu and it was FANTASTIC. We started with the winter and goats n' greens salads (both were flavorful) and the beef tartare which was just MOUTH-WATERINGLY TASTY! My bf's mom ordered the Chilean Sea Bass and that is just about as good as it gets, my bf got the Chicken, and I got the Cioppino. The mussels, scallops, crab, and clams were fresh and the homemade sauce was delectable. Nabbed a wine bottle for the table as it was 1/2 off (Rosato, Italy 2012) and it was refreshing- not my favorite, but decent. The service (Ivor, our waiter) was on point, the food was amazing, and the company even better, so overall a 5-star experience here. \n\nAlso, the pesto sauce that comes with the bread is TO DIE FOR. Don't even bother with the butter. We've been here numerous times since they opened. Nice interior and well prepared food. Reasonable choice for a nicer meal. Wine and whiskey, etc. selection is quite good. As with a lot of Pittsburgh restaurants, service is hit or miss. During our most recent meal, the server was very knowledgeable about the wine and food, warm and engaging, but not very attentive.\n\nUpdate - After reading my review Cioppino contacted me to discuss our experience. Very impressed by this and shows that they truly want to provide a great experience. Thanks! We'll be back. Cioppino is now one of my favorite places to grab a drink in Pittsburgh. Very relaxed atmosphere and Andy is one of the most knowledgeable bartenders that I have ever met. He creates top notch drinks and is very passionate about his craft.  The Fig Higgins with the fat washed Whistle Pig is by far my favorite drink on the menu.  The price may seem a little high for a cocktail, but it is definitely worth every penny! I would highly recommend making the trip to Cioppino to anyone, and make sure to grab a cocktail from Andy. Only visited the cigar bar.  It is very nice and classy.  Great ventilation compared to other places. Brought my own cigar, so I cant rate the selection.\nProbably only two around as nice.  Beer priced well too. It's Primanti's. It's a gem. A Pittsburgh legend. You're visiting from out of town? Then Primanti's you MUST go.\n\nNormally, I hit up the Southside location to get my primanti's fix, but I was in the strip and we wanted something filling and cheap, so we came here. I got the turkey sandwich with a fried egg and my boyfriend got the steak. We both adored them, as we always do. The amount of food you get for the amount of money you pay, is insane. The bread is so fresh and everything is ALWAYS tasty. Plus, the staff is friendly and that's always a bonus.\n\nIf you haven't always tried Primanti's, then you must. There really isn't another choice. stopped here tonight  for a beer and a burger and is was good....meet crystal the barmaid and she couldn't have been nicer.....what a pleasure....the P.B.R/'s were cold and the burger was tasty....great coleslaw...different !....nice crowd, friendly and a cool atmosphere!   restroom was clean and looking into the kitchen...well I approve....def. check out this place when your in town The cook was such a nice guy, plus he wasn't bad looking either. The food was made right in front of you (if you're sitting at the counter), so you know how your food is being prepared. The food is, what it is. Meat, slaw, bread, fries cheese etc. And lots of it. I only ate half of my sandwich. It was ok. Nothing super special. But I was told I had to go there when in Pittsburgh. This is one of my absolute favorite places to eat!  Everything - the service, the atmosphere and the food is all fantastic.  If you are craving a Pittsburgh Sammich there is really no where else you can go. Love love love this place. It's open 24 hours and on New Years. This was my first time in Pittsburgh and everyone told me to go here. This is what Pitt is known for. Typically when people tell me I have to try a staple of a certain city, I am left disappointed because it's overhyped, the wait is typically forever, and the food is not THAT good. However Primanti Bros was not overhyped for nothing. \n\nI walk in and there's open seating everywhere. It was crowded but not overly crowded. I hate when there's a wait and I see a bunch of open tables. primantis self seating was perfect. The waitress came over right away and got us our drinks. Idk if this time was just not as busy because it's New Year's Day and I was there during the steelers game (they were playing the browns... there's not a worse team in the NFL). \n\nWe ordered. I got 3 sandwiches (Cajun chicken, pastrami, and the pittsburger), and the smallman chilli cheese fries. The fries came out immediately. It was faster than jimmy johns and it was hot and fresh and delicious. The 3 sandwiches came out in less than 5 min after. The service was impeccably quick! \n\nThe smallman chilli cheese fries were topped with chilli, sour cream and bacon. It could honestly use a bit more bacon but they were delicious. The sandwiches all come with Cole slaw and fries stuffed in them. The Cole slaw was perfect, it was not overly flavored so it did not take away from the taste of the meats. The French fries were crispy so it added a bit of a crunch to the sandwich. All the meats were perfectly cooked to the right tenderness. They were evenly cut on halves and served to us on plastic wrap and not a plate. I prefer this because it's more economical. \n\nFor $7, these sandwiches are ridiculously filling, I couldn't even finish each half out of the 3 sandwiches that I ordered.\n\nHighly recommend coming here. If I'm ever back in Pittsburgh, this will definitely be my first stop again! I went to college in Pittsburgh so I have been before and missed it.  Was in cleveland forba business trip and drove to Pittsburgh just for it.  It did not disappoint.  One of the most unique sandwiches I have ever had.  Would never think that Cole slaw and French fries would be so good but it is.  A must for anybody visiting Pittsburgh as this is something you can only get here It is exactly as described... fast, fresh food with fries and slaw on the sandwich. The food comes out very quickly so there were a lot of people doing to go orders. The staff was friendly and attentive. It can get VERY crowded so if you don't want to wait, you really need to plan to go during a slow time. They are open 24 hours, so we went for breakfast but I don't mind a big sandwich and some chili cheese fries for breakfast. What better way to start the day? Great vibe and great food! If your in the Pittsburgh area you have to stop in and get a sandwich. The amount of food you get for the low price is insane ! I love the Pittsburgh sandwich ! I go like twice a month ! They advertise as a biscotti bakery (and those are good to be sure), but I love them for their oven fresh butter croissant. They're huge and flakey. If you get in there around 8 they're still warm and a little crunchy. They have lots of other pastry as well. Give 'me a shot if your in the Strip.", "stars": 4.0}, "The Hill District": {"year": 2017, "text": "The hostess was polite but the fact that they're in such close proximity of an arena should make her more aware that people may want to sit near a tv when sporting events are on. While we were there 3 people asked to sit hear a tv in a fairly empty restaurant. The place was clean and the service was great we got our drinks and food in a timely manner. The steak had gristle but I happen to like a little bit of it on my steak. I had the Jack Daniel ribeye and shrimp with mashed potatoes and broccoli. They had $4 Long Island Iced Tea which was impressive for a Saturday evening. Cool atmosphere for any day when there's no sporting event at PPG Paints Arena. The reviews made me want to try this place out the food is made to order and taste awesome I will be back Amazing southern comfort food for an unbeatable price.  I got the BBQ wings with two sides  - the spicy mustard sauce the chef added was amazing.  The green beans taste exactly how they should, and the mac and cheese was creamy and delicious.  My boyfriend raved about the ribs and the cole slaw.  We can't wait to go back.  Would 100% recommend.  Just FYI, Not much room to sit inside, but there is some. I haven't actually eaten here, only ordered delivery, but it was delicious and I am looking forward to checking this place out for some more BBQ!\n\nWe had a craving for some wings during a football game and decided to try this place out. At first glance, we were a little disappointed that the wings seemed to be smoked rather than the typical crispy buffalo hot wings. As soon as I took a bite, my mind changed instantly! \n\nThe meat was, as cliche as it sounds, falling off the bone and the flavor was amazing. You could put the wing in your mouth and pull all of the meat off by barely using your lips. The meat was smokey and juicy and we easily devoured the entire order. The food is addicting. Such great BBQ. Smoked chicken wings are the. Eat I've ever had.  I could eat their food all day.  The sides are awesome too.  Get the greens...get lots of them, by far, the best I've ever had.  Wherever you are in Pittsburgh, come to this place for BBQ, you won't regret it. Me & friends deciding to come here choosing over TGIFs pregame meal before Pens game. Great seating if your with a group of 4 or more. TVs are conveniently placed so you cant miss the big game,which  we watched a Steeler playoff game so you can the ambience!! Place was BUZZING! Now,about the food... I ordered the Build your own steak burger with fried egg on ciabatta. It was meaty,great angus flavor cooked perfectly medium. Delicious!! my only disappointment with this place they didn't have wings for an app,the fellas gotta have wings anywhere we go,lol! Overall, me & guys will return great place to enjoy the game!!", "stars": 3.9}, "Troy Hill": {"year": 2017, "text": "This place is awesome.  The beer is excellent and the food is great.  It's a little loud- I was there on a Saturday night- but the vibe is casual and comfy.  Get something with the bier cheese.  Yum! Went there on the night of New Year's Day for dinner. Our server was very nice, but not the greatest, and the food was pretty good but overpriced. I asked for a water with my beer immediately when we got there, I didn't see that water until I had to ask for it again which at that point was when my meal was just about over. Specifically asked for no onions on my burger, which of course came with onions on it. And, when my burger arrived, I waited about 20 minutes before I started eating it because I wanted ketchup, which was not brought out with my meal and our server didn't even make a cameo to check up with us until well after our entrees arrived. I have no inclination to visit Penn Brewery again. Yummy sandwiches, great coffee and a fantastic space! It's my go to spot for meeting friends, doing a little work. Love the atmosphere had a great cup of coffee so I was very pleased ! Sn: the sandwiches are also good We went for an early dinner on NYE. The place has a really unique yet comfortable vibe and ambiance. Our server was very helpful in describing the dishes and making recommendations. The food was absolutely delicious. The main dishes were pricey given the portion size was much more like a lunch plate. That being said, it was worth the food quality.  It was REALLY cold in the bar side which is where our table was. I had my coat and gloves on. Overall I would recommend this place if you're looking for a delicious meal. I would not recommend this restaurant for these reason:\n1. Too expensive for the really small potion sizes.\n2. The quality of the food was not good.\n3. I patdenham78@yahoo.com$2 extra for meat on my taco... 2 strips that were tiny on 2 tacos.  Really.\n4.

Horrible. The quality of food was terrible. Garbage. The waitress could notspeak English well. I asked for coka and they did not know what is the coke. Everything taste like socks. Spending a penny is too much for this place. Great little local bar with awesome and cheap drink specials. The bar splits in to two different sections when you walk in. Booths on the left if you want to grab a bit to eat and sit.  A bunch of tables/space around the bar you'd rather just hang out to the right. We love Blinky's! No frills and thrills. Literally a hole in the wall dinner. Dirty, old, run down. Amazing food! Piping hot! Soooooo good! Pancakes were the size of the plates and thick! The toast was to perfection with an abundant amount of butter. Eggs were perfect. Sausage was spicy and authentic. Not boring store bought. Ham was thick and seasoned perfect!

In case you were aware, Isalys is an acronym for \"I Shall Always Love You Sweetie\".\n\nIn any event, they have solid breakfast game in Westview. It's really inexpensive, and the portions are more than generous.  Parking isn't too difficult to find on a weekend, but they're only open until 2pm - since the bulk of their business is breakfast and lunch diners.  A Pittsburgh original, creator of the Klondike. Check out Isalys if you haven't yet.  You never know when you'll wake up and it's gone like the rest of the 100+ Isalys in the Greater Pittsburgh area. If I could give a zero star I would. I've been living near this dunkin for a long time and it is total crap now. They ALWAYS mess up your order. Most of the people that work there don't care about you or your food/drinks. They consistently do NOT put the flavorings in your coffee drink, forget your hash browns, make a mistake so you get \"upgraded\" for free, or have coffee spilling down the side. I would drive 20 mins out of my 3 minute drive to go somewhere better. Horrible absolutely horrible. I've been going to this Dunkin' about once a week for about 6 months now. I keep hoping that someday they will get my order right.\n\n Hasn't happened yet but someday! \n\nI believe in you! You can do it guys!!! Over an hour and twenty minutes now for a sandwich and breadsticks. ON A FRIDAY AFTERNOON!!!! No call to say they are running behind, nothing! I will never order from them again. Food is always amazing, especially the Buffalo chicken pizza.  Their homemade ranch dressing is the best! We have had them deliver a couple of times and have never had a problem. When we pick up at the store staff is always friendly. We drove the extra 10 minutes to give this place a try instead of our normal chinese take out in Crafton. It definately was worth the drive. The general tso chicken was made to perfection as well as the egg rolls and fried rice. The price was a little bit higher than our local place but it was still under $10 per person. If you are within 15 minutes of this place and like chinese take out, I would definitely recommend Yueng's. Wings , burgers and service really good !   Drama free and fresh ingredients !    Prime rib sandwich looked great !  My fellow diners sucked it up with rave reviews ! Okay - I think I've found the achilles heel of DiPietro's - and that is the regular pasta in meat sauce. The linguine was coated in the red meat sauce, but it was not thick at all and hardly meaty. It's disappointing as dishes like their Chicken Marsala and the Chicken a la DiPietro are so very good. My husband goes here a lot and hits the drive-through to pick up a chicken sandwich for my dinner - at least once every two weeks or so. I like the regular breaded chicken sandwich with cheese and extra lettuce and extra tomato. Often it ends up coming out with a ton of mayonnaise as well because they just put extra everything. I believe, however, that has more to do with the average fast-food worker as opposed to anything that might be lacking in this particular location. I really love their Strawberry Lemonade but at least 45% of the time the machine is either not working or they run out of the strawberry component of the drink. \n\nThis is a typically average fast-food restaurant. One of the greatest places around!!! Off the main road of McKnight, kitchen open late (Until 1 am) EVERYDAY!! Recent remodel with a badass double corn-hole court equipped with fire pit in the center.  Enclosed smoking area outside for smokers. Games galore; pool, darts, pinball, etc. This place has some of the best specials I've ever seen in a bar, both food and drink. Efficient bar seating and Lots of tables and areas to spread out with your buds. Happy hour menu is honestly too much to ask for, come here with 4 friends and just order everything off the happy hour menu as it's all half price!!

There's always parking on the street - easy in and out.    I only stop when there isn't a line because sometimes the wait is a little too long for me.\n\nBrowsing the menu - nothing seemed to jump out at me just the typical options. I went with a medium sundae - nuts - hot fudge and bananas.  It was $5.50. I was a bit surprised it was over $5.00. It wasn't huge or anything but not small either.    It was just a typical ice cream sundae.  Its all the convenience you pay for. You can get a tub of ice cream or $5.00. \n\n On a hot day - ice cream sure hits the spot. I am grateful for this establishment existence because its the closest one to me but feel the prices could be a little bit more average.\nI haven't experienced what other reviewer's have - with the lights and music.  Its just a little cream shop if you are in the mood for a ice cream or a sundae. Great ice cream, not so great with everything else. I didn't realize the $10 credit card minimum, which I totally understand being a small business. I added a cookie and a bottle of water to my order to get me to the magical number. When I got to the car, the bottle of water had a broken seal and was no longer full. The cookie was hard as a rock, definitely baked much earlier than I would like to think about. In conclusion, their ice cream is great, but stick to just that and definitely bring cash! I didn't know what to expect when I came here thinking this was an actual ice cream shop where it is actually an ice cream stand.\n\nThere are signs posted on the wall telling you not to use your cellphone when you are ordering, They accept credit cards not debit with a minimal $10.00 purchase. That is never a problem for me since my banking cards have both options attached to them. They also won't service you if you are in line straddling a bike.\n\nThe size of the cones they serve are reminiscent of Isaly's. Prices are reasonable for the quantity you get. Believe me when I say unless you are very hungry order a small. It is huge!\n\nin addition to soft serve cones and cups they also offer hard ice cream in various flavors. I got to chat with the owner Mary who makes these flavors up herself and adds her own special touch to them. Yes, you can sample them. Since I prefer hard ice cream I settled for two scoops of Black Forest ice cream complete with cherries. She offered me a lid and explained the things the business does.\n\nIn addition to selling ice cream and the usual flare every Fri and Sun evenings when it is nice they have a DeeJay come out and play music from the 50s. Once a month they have a special event. Recently they had a group of students from CMU come out and teach people how to line dance. They have a car cruise in the works. More information she told me can be found either on their website or Facebook page.\n\nMy ice cream was very good and quite filling! There are a couple of picnic tables you can sit at if you wish. There isn't very much parking in the area. They also have a rewards card. You must spend a minimum of $3.00 to get a hole punch and then after 10 punches you get $1.00 off your purchase.  They also have ice cream for purchase if you want a quart, half gallon, etc. Costs a bit more than the grocery stores but hey if it's good then it's worth the money to me.\n\nThis place is close to home so I definitely plan to return to check out more of the offerings. Next time I may bend and try a soft cone dipped in chocolate. So much to choose from. Definitely 4 1/2 stars in my book.", "stars": 3.0}}
